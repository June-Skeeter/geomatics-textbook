  abstract = {Purpose Improving valuation accuracy, especially for sale and acquisition purposes, remains one of the key targets of the global real estate research agenda. Among other recommendations, it has been argued that the use of technology-based advanced valuation methods can help to narrow the gap between asset valuations and actual sale prices. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the property valuation methods being adopted by Australian valuers and the factors influencing their level of awareness and adoption of the methods. Design/methodology/approach An online questionnaire survey was conducted to elicit information from valuers practising in Australia. They were asked to indicate their level of awareness and adoption of the different property valuation methods. Their response was analysed using frequency distribution, {$\chi$}2 test and mean score ranking. Findings The results show that the traditional methods of valuation, namely, comparative, investment and residual, are the most adopted methods by the Australian valuers, while advanced valuation methods are seldom applied in practice. The results confirm that professional bodies, sector of practice and educational institutions are the three most important drivers of awareness and adoption of the advanced valuation methods. Practical implications There is a need for all the property valuation stakeholders to synergise and transform the property valuation practice in a bid to promote the awareness and adoption of advanced valuation methods, (e.g. hedonic pricing model, artificial neural network, expert system, fuzzy logic system, etc.) among valuers. These are all technology-based methods to improve the efficiency in the prediction process, and the valuer still needs to input reliable transaction data into the systems. Originality/value This study provides a fresh and most recent insight into the current property valuation methods adopted in practice by valuers practising in Australia. It identifies that the advanced valuation methods could supplement the traditional valuation methods to achieve good practice standard for improving the professional valuation practice in Australia so that the valuation profession can meet the industry's expectations.},

  abstract = {The growth of Decentralized Energy Systems (DES) signals a new frontier in urban energy planning and design of local energy systems. As affordability of renewable energy technologies (RET) increases, cities and urban regions become the venues, not only for energy consumption but also for generation and distribution, which calls for systemic and paradigmatic change in local energy infrastructure. The decentralizing transitions of urban energy systems, particularly solar photovoltaic and thermal technologies, require a comprehensive assessment of their sociotechnical co-evolution \textendash{} how technologies and social responses evolve together and how their co-evolution affects urban planning and energy policies. So far, urban planning literature has mainly focused on the impact of physical urban forms on efficiency of energy consumption, overlooking how the dynamics of new energy technologies and associated social responses affect local systems of energy infrastructure, the built environments and their residents. This paper provides an interdisciplinary review on the co-evolving technical and social dynamics of DES focusing on Distributed Generation (DG), MicroGrids (MG), and Smart MicroGrids (SMG), in order to draw insights for their integration in urban planning and policy, in particular reference to climate change mitigation and adaptation planning.},

The analysis uses qualitative and quantitative data derived from two studies: the regional (macro) integrated transport and land-use model data and the micro-analysis of ten selected neighbourhoods, both of which have taken place in the North East of England. The interview with local authorities demonstrated that, despite the sustainability agenda being high on their list, there are issues with embracing social, economic and environmental aspects in equal manner, relating to transport. The macro-analysis shows that different land-use scenarios influence only a small part of travel behaviour. The main argument was that the changes in land-uses and transport provision are relatively marginal, compared to the existing development. The micro-study, on the other hand, demonstrated that it is the attitudes of citizens, rather than the neighbourhood characteristics, which play the bigger role in influencing the patterns of car travel, thus suggesting that future policy work on attitudes may have a bigger impact in influencing travel behaviour.},

In the face of these problems, social policy initiatives have emerged that have travelled under various names: social investment, micro-finance, community finance and community development finance. These initiatives are seen as the basis of a `new economics' that will create self-sustaining local economies. The government is also promoting community development finance as an aspect of community regeneration with the aim of providing credit to poor communities to stimulate local enterprise and thereby reduce dependency on state support. The same approach is being taken to grant-funded community and voluntary organisations to encourage them into a neo-market approach to the delivery of services. This article explores the phenomenon of community development finance and assesses its proposed role in community regeneration and in relation to the community and voluntary sector.},

  abstract = {A massive amount of information as geo-referenced data is now emerging from the digitization of contemporary cities. Urban streets networks are characterized by a fairly uniform degree distribution and a low degree range. Therefore, the analysis of the graph constructed from the topology of the urban layout does not provide significant information when studying topology-based centrality. On the other hand, we have collected geo-located data about the use of various buildings and facilities within the city. This does provide a rich source of information about the importance of various areas. Despite this, we still need to consider the influence of topology, as this determines the interaction between different areas. In this paper, we propose a new model of centrality for urban networks based on the concept of Eigenvector Centrality for urban street networks which incorporates information from both topology and data residing on the nodes. So, the centrality proposed is able to measure the influence of two factors, the topology of the network and the geo-referenced data extracted from the network and associated to the nodes. We detail how to compute the centrality measure and provide the rational behind it. Some numerical examples with small networks are performed to analyse the characteristics of the model. Finally, a detailed example of a real urban street network is discussed, taking a real set of data obtained from a fieldwork, regarding the commercial activity developed in the city.},

We consider 347 estimates of density elasticities of a broad range of outcomes ranging from wages, innovation, rents, various amenities, the cost of providing public services, transport- and environment-related outcomes to health and wellbeing. More than 100 of these estimates have not been previously published and have been provided by authors on request or inferred from published results in auxiliary analyses. We contribute original estimates of density elasticities of 16 distinct outcome variables that belong to categories where the evidence base is thin, inconsistent or non-existent. Along with a critical discussion of the quality and the quantity of the evidence base we present a set of recommended elasticities. Applying them to a scenario that roughly corresponds to an average high-income city, we find that density seems to be a net-amenity that is associated with positive external welfare effects. Densification policies may be welfare enhancing, but the distributional effects may be regressive, especially if residents are immobile and housing supply is inelastic.},

  abstract = {Intervenir los sistemas de transporte y uso de suelo producen diversos impactos en las ciudades, afectando de diferentes maneras a los grupos de poblaci\'on que habitan la ciudad. Primero, la falta o deterioro severo de la accesibilidad puede causar dificultades significativas para acceder a oportunidades de trabajo, estudio, recreaci\'on, salud e interacci\'on social, desencadenando el fen\'omeno de exclusi\'on social. Segundo, la forma y estructura interna de una ciudad tienen un impacto sustancial en la asequibilidad, concepto que alude al estr\'es financiero que enfrentan los hogares al cubrir sus gastos de vivienda y transporte. Tercero, (una falta de) transporte puede ser la causa o la soluci\'on de muchos aspectos vinculados a la pobreza e inequidad, dependiendo c\'omo aborde o no las necesidades de los grupos de poblaci\'on m\'as necesitados o cuan (in)justa sea la distribuci\'on de los beneficios asociados a inversiones de transporte.
 Dos de los 17 Objetivos de Desarrollo Sustentable definidos por las Naciones Unidas se relacionan a los tres problemas antes mencionados: ``Fin a la pobreza'' y ``Ciudades y comunidades sustentables''. Dentro de otras acciones, proveer de vivienda asequible, mejorar el acceso al transporte y oportunidades, y promover el transporte p\'ublico puede ayudar a lograr tales objetivos. Estos objetivos son especialmente importantes para regiones como Sudam\'erica, donde la inequidad y segregaci\'on social es particularmente alta.
 Considerando que la relaci\'on entre pobreza y transporte a menudo est\'a ausente o no se aborda adecuadamente en la literatura ni en el dise\~no de infraestructura y pol\'iticas p\'ublicas relacionadas con el transporte, el objetivo principal de esta investigaci\'on es estudiar los problemas de accesibilidad y asequibilidad derivados de la interacci\'on entre los sistemas de transporte y uso de suelo, y c\'omo estos problemas contribuyen a la reducci\'on, producci\'on o mantenci\'on de la inequidad y la pobreza relacionadas con el transporte dentro de las ciudades, particularmente en Santiago, Chile.
 Para lograr este objetivo, se emplean m\'etodos mixtos de investigaci\'on bajo una estrategia cuantitativa dominante. Se utilizan m\'etodos cuantitativos, incluyendo (i) la formulaci\'on y c\'alculo de indicadores de accesibilidad, asequibilidad y entorno urbano, (ii) an\'alisis gr\'aficos y espaciales usando datos de transporte y vivienda y (iii) m\'etodos probabil\'isticos para analizar la asequibilidad de transporte y vivienda. Adem\'as, se utilizan m\'etodos cualitativos (grupos focales bajo un marco de an\'alisis de contenido), complementando y profundizando el an\'alisis de los objetivos 2 y 3. Todos los objetivos se apoyan de herramientas de Sistemas de Informaci\'on Geogr\'afica para visualizar los resultados principales.
 Los resultados obtenidos muestran una brecha de inequidad que afecta principalmente a los grupos m\'as vulnerables (personas de bajos ingresos, mujeres, adultos mayores, familias con hijos y aquellos localizados lejos de los centros de actividades). Esta inequidad es multidimensional e involucra el acceso al transporte p\'ublico, la calidad del entorno urbano, el nivel de servicio experimentado y la posibilidad de elegir libremente la localizaci\'on del hogar y alternativas de transporte. Adem\'as, es posible concluir que existen grupos de poblaci\'on que est\'an sistem\'aticamente en desventaja en tres de los cuatro factores que contribuyen a la pobreza del transporte: movilidad, accesibilidad y asequibilidad.
 Esta tesis realiza diversas contribuciones. Primero, contribuciones metodol\'ogicas para expandir el concepto y la operacionalizaci\'on de la accesibilidad, incluido el uso de m\'etodos mixtos. Por un lado, la investigaci\'on incluye la percepci\'on del nivel de servicio en las medidas de accesibilidad y la calidad del entorno urbano. Por otro lado, la investigaci\'on propone un nuevo marco te\'orico para mejorar el an\'alisis de accesibilidad a trav\'es del an\'alisis de datos cualitativos. En segundo lugar, estos hallazgos y metodolog\'ias contribuyen a la formulaci\'on de pol\'iticas en temas de accesibilidad y accesibilidad, como el caso de educaci\'on, las tarifas basadas en la distancia y las \'areas de integraci\'on social. Finalmente, se estiman distribuciones de costos de vivienda y transporte utilizando agrupaciones espaciales y funciones de probabilidad, y luego se utilizan para analizar la "libertad de elecci\'on" que tienen las personas de bajos ingresos, dadas sus limitaciones presupuestarias.
 La investigaci\'on proporciona insumos \'utiles para la planificaci\'on integrada del transporte y el uso del suelo. Se espera que los resultados permitan la priorizaci\'on de la inversi\'on p\'ublica (espacio p\'ublico, servicios b\'asicos, transporte y vivienda) y la formulaci\'on de pol\'iticas p\'ublicas intersectoriales para reducir la brecha de desigualdad y la pobreza en Santiago.},

  abstract = {As COVID-19 infections wreak havoc across the globe, attention has rightly been focused on the vital organ systems (lung, kidney and heart) that are vulnerable to viral attack and contribute to the acute pathology associated with this disease. However, we should not lose sight of the fact that COVID-19 will attack any cell type in the body expressing ACE2 - including human spermatozoa. These cells possess the entire repertoire of receptors (AT1R, AT2R, MAS) and ligand processing enzymes (ACE1 and ACE2) needed to support the angiotensin signalling cascade. The latter not only provides COVID-19 with a foothold on the sperm surface but may also promote integration, given the additional presence of a range of proteases (TMPRSS2, TMPRSS11B, TMPRSS12, furin) capable of promoting viral fusion. This article reviews the roles played by these various cellular constituents in maintaining the vitality of human spermatozoa and their competence for fertilization. The reproductive consequences of a viral attack on these systems, in terms of fertility and the risk of sexual transmission, are currently unknown. However, we should be alive to the possibility that there may be reproductive consequences of COVID-19 infection in young males that go beyond their capacity to survive a viral attack.},

  abstract = {Spatial embeddedness and planarity of urban road networks limit the range of their node degree values. Therefore, pursuing analysis based on the distribution of node degrees e.g. scale free aspect could not be accomplished in urban road networks. We have inspected the distribution of degree, betweenness centrality, weighted degree (based on incident link capacities), and alpha weighted degree for eight urban road networks across the world. These networks are abstracted from Philadelphia (USA), Berlin (Germany), Chicago (USA), Anaheim (USA), Gold Coast (Australia), Birmingham (UK), and Isfahan (Iran). Our results show that although the degree (weighted and unweighted) distributions of these networks are totally different, they all show power law distributions in betweenness centrality. Thus, scale free aspect could be observed in the betweenness centrality distribution. We then analyzed the collapse of network as a result of node removals. The collapse patterns suggest that critical nodes of urban road networks could not be detected solely based on betweenness centrality. Therefore, we conclude that the concept of betweenness centrality in urban road networks is more of functional merit than topological merit. In other words, central nodes play an important role in transmitting the flow but their loss would not harm the connectivity of urban networks. This claim is supported by analyzing the correlation among node flow and node betweenness in Isfahan and Anaheim.},

Voxel-based spatial representation is utilised as a base for the 3D visibility analysis. Different space configurations are tested illustrating the robustness and usefulness of the developed application. In order to measure and evaluate different safety zones, an innovative approach is tested according to which the number of times each voxel is observed is recorded and further classified into different zones. In this way, an accurate calculation of the observed space can be performed understanding which part of an area of interest is less or more observed. The research has shown great potential for first responders, researchers, architects and safety experts. The developed application can be used as a simulation tool to assess the safety of different urban environments and identify potentially vulnerable locations.},

  abstract = {Debate about social-spatial ordering systems began as the opposition between planning and markets. This symposium discusses a related dichotomy: teleocracy (traditional directive planning) vs. nomocracy: social-spatial ordering by general-relational rules. This debate is not only theory; real institutional proposals and alternative practices demonstrate its practical relevance. In addition to the introduction, three contributions make up this volume. Why Nomocracy elaborates the case for nomocracy, claiming its superior effectiveness and morality. Only general relational rules can guide complex societies and enable spontaneous order in the face of structural ignorance, which defeats teleocratic projects and plans. Normatively, radical pluralism prescribes nomocracy as the preferred alternative to teleocracies that imply a particular vision of the ``good society''. Spatial planning rules and regulations distinguishes between planning as a government decision process and planning as a technical activity, emphasising the cyclical character of spatial planning processes and the technical autonomy of rules and regulation. Definitional analysis concludes that spatial planning is essentially nomocratic, with grids and rules determining cities' morphologies. Though`nomocracy' and `teleocracy' may have some heuristic value, this dichotomy is not very helpful for planning practice. Towards a dialectic theory of planning proposes a synthesis that recognises nomocracy and teleocracy as complementary social ordering systems. An association between nomocracy and institutions, and between teleocracy and organisations was found, which has limited analytical value but offers useful normative rules. Whilst ideal types of planning seem associated with teleocracy or nomocracy, the real world demands both, suggesting contingent rules for adopting these modes in planning. Two points of general agreement are:-Nomocracy is the preferred social-spatial ordering approach for regulating complex self-organising systems \textendash{} societies and cities.-These concepts \textendash{} nomocracy and teleocracy \textendash{} have limited use for applied research and empirical analysis of planning practices. But the contributors disagree on definitions, leading to divergent normative conclusions:1.Nomocracy should be the dominant social-spatial ordering system. State planning for other sectors should be limited to nomocratic instruments, defined as universal-general relational laws and rules.2.Rule-based spatial planning can be viewed as a form of nomocracy, necessary for spatial expression of the polity's public interest. Such planning includes schematic spatial topologies (e.g. the urban grid) and regulative planning.3.Nomocracy and teleocracy are complementary social-spatial orders. A planning subject should act as an institution when ``planning for others'', using nomocratic tools to promote common values; when ``planning for itself'' it should use teleocratic tools acting as an organisation to realise its goals.},

This is true both for the rational comprehensive theory of the 1960s and the 1990s postmodern theory of communicative planning theory. In this article we claim that current planning weaknesses, on the one hand, and viewing cities as complex self-organizing systems, on the other, require re-linking planning theory, law, and administration to the substantive qualitative relations between the various urban elements. We then introduce, first, an example for theorizing such an `Urban Code' that turns the spatial relations into a planning rule and, second, a suggestion for a planning system that is responsive to these qualitative relations and is capable of updating them.},

Our approach uses the structure and image data of real-world urban areas and a synthesis algorithm to provide several high-level operations to easily and interactively generate complex layouts by example. The user can create new urban layouts by a sequence of operations such as join, expand, and blend without being concerned about low-level structural details. Further, the ability to blend example urban layout fragments provides a powerful way to generate new synthetic content. We demonstrate our system by creating urban layouts using example fragments from several real-world cities, each ranging from hundreds to thousands of city blocks and parcels.},

  abstract = {Port Louis, the capital city of Mauritius, has been the preferred city for hosting the judicial, political and business activities of the country for the past two centuries. However, new policies have created nine new smart cities in greenfield locations within 10 km from Port Louis, so the capital city is facing economic decline as it is losing businesses, as well as administrative functions. This loss equates to an erosion in municipal revenue along with a reduced interest in contributing to the development of the city; all of which takes a toll on its urban economic landscape, as well as on the broader Mauritian economy. This paper builds from the findings of a focus group study to propose a smart urban regeneration model for the City of Port Louis, which could enable the old city to be restored and regenerated rather than redeveloped in modernist architecture, as has happened in the new smart cities model. A smart urban regeneration model is proposed backed by the pillars of smart infrastructure, culture, metabolism and governance. The proposed model is applied to the context of Port Louis to generate an urban regeneration scheme. The potential benefits in terms of financial outcomes, investment attraction and job creation are explored through a combined application of econometric forecasting models. The results support positive figures of both investment and job creation, and the findings of this study aim at informing and providing the governing bodies of Port Louis with a tangible solution for revamping the centuries-old capital city, as well as demonstrating to the world that smart cities can mean sensitive urban regeneration.},

  abstract = {A great deal of planning literature in the last decade has been devoted to growth management and the concept of land use and transportation interactions. "New" approaches to planning, such as Transit Oriented Development (TOD) and Neo-Traditional Neighbourhood Design, are products of this evaluation of current development practices. The influence of housing affordability and accessibility, although intuitively related to the growth management problems of urban sprawl and automobile dependence, has often been overlooked. The purpose of this research is to bridge important gaps in our understanding of how residential land use and transportation infrastructure investments are shaping unsustainable growth and travel patterns in the GVRD, which is the main problem being addressed. The research objectives related to this problem are the correlation of observed trends in growth, housing and travel indicators, the determination of the importance of price and accessibility factors in household location decisions, and the analysis of the role that land use and transportation decisions have played in influencing housing costs and accessibility. To provide a context for understanding the scope of the problem and the relationships between the research results and proposed recommendations, the applicable literature, theory, and policies in the areas of growth management, land use, transportation and housing are given. Supporting research results include: a survey of senior stakeholders in the region on land use, transportation and housing issues; a synthesis of significant socioeconomic, growth, transportation and housing data; a summary of surveys outlining preferences for residential location and housing type; and an analysis of Place of Work data crosstabulated against Place of Residence and socioeconomic variables. The results show a strong dependency between location decisions and the cost and accessibility of housing, particularly for the critical group of younger households with children. Policy recommendations, based on the research and covering land use, transportation, housing, governance and education, are proposed to address the main sustainability problems studied. The recommendations focus on promoting affordable, higher density communities, with a choice of transportation modes, as an attractive alternative to lower density, automobile-dependent suburbs.},

This paper addresses that gap by presenting a scenario exercise using an integrated suite of sectoral and whole systems models to explore potential energy pathways in the UK transport sector. Techno-economic driven scenarios are contrasted with one in which social change is strongly influenced by concerns about energy use, the environment and well-being. The `what if' Lifestyle scenario reveals a future in which distance travelled by car is reduced by 74\% by 2050 and final energy demand from transport is halved compared to the reference case. Despite the more rapid uptake of electric vehicles and the larger share of electricity in final energy demand, it shows a future where electricity decarbonisation could be delayed. The paper illustrates the key trade-off between the more aggressive pursuit of purely technological fixes and demand reduction in the transport sector and concludes there are strong arguments for pursuing both demand and supply side solutions in the pursuit of emissions reduction and energy security.},

Our analysis is based on a model of the rental, asset- and construction markets, the results are quality-assured by interviews with market actors. Prices and profits are affected when constructors are forced, through parking norms, to build more parking spaces than the customers demand. Parking norms reduce the housing stock by 1.2\% and increase rents by 2.4\% (SEK 300) in our example suburb.},

We use the estimated model to simulate how rental rates would respond to an exogenous increase in the number of housing units in a neighborhood. We find that the rent elasticity is low, and thus marginal reductions in supply constraints alone are unlikely to meaningfully reduce rent burdens. The reason for this result appears to be that rental rates are more closely determined by the level of amenities in a neighborhood\textemdash as in a Rosen-Roback spatial equilibrium framework\textemdash than by the supply of housing.},

  abstract = {Location affordability is a policy concept that links housing costs with transport costs, recognizing that assessing  affordability should consider the combined costs incurred by a given location choice. As a more holistic perspective on affordability than traditional thresholds of housing costs alone, location affordability opens new possibilities for applied analyses that suggest a need for stronger coordination between housing and transport sectors in policy, planning, and project development.   A range of housing and transport system configurations can result in affordable locations. For example, it may be that high housing cost burdens in densely developed urban markets can be softened by the use of low-cost transportation services, such as public transit, cycling, or walking.  Intensely urban areas are usually more compatible with low-cost transport modes because distances are shorter and density concentrates people so as to make public transit feasible. Conversely, in areas where there is little pressure on land markets and development is at low densities, housing prices are usually lower. Yet such areas are inefficient and expensive to serve by public transit; at the same time, long distances between work and residential locations make walking or cycling infeasible. As a result, households rely on private automobiles for transport, which require substantial investment to purchase, maintain, and operate one or more vehicles. Between these two extremes are a variety of patterns where households' housing and transport costs reflect the joint configuration of the land development and transport systems in a city. This joint configuration, or urban form, creates an influential backdrop for household location decisions and affects household cost structures.    In recent decades, scholars have focused on the phenomenon of urban sprawl, broadly understood to be ex-urban, low-density development, with segregated land uses and an orientation toward automobile use. Although there is general agreement on what sprawl is, there is weak consensus on a consistent definition appropriate for use in empirical studies. This is not merely an academic problem:  If research is to provide evidence on location affordability to policy- and decision-makers, a coherent and clear conceptualization of the relevant dimensions of urban form is needed to identify specific strategies that support affordability.   This paper makes two contributions to the affordability literature. First, it operationalizes location unaffordability using Census tract-level mortgage foreclosure rates during the recent housing crisis as an outcome measure. From this perspective, foreclosures are an observable effect of some combination of factors that resulted in a dwelling unit becoming unaffordable such that the homeowner defaults on a home mortgage. This is in contrast to typical methods that accept normative thresholds for affordability (i.e. 30\% of household income). Second, it uses multi-dimensional measures of urban form - recently developed by Andrea Sarzynski, George Galster, and Lisa Stack (2014) - to estimate the effect of particular patterns of development on affordability. These data are combined with demographic and household cost data in a series of spatial regression models for 35 US cities that exhibited the greatest changes in their development patterns over the preceding decade (1990s).},

Such spaces include the use of global online social networks, locative media, e-participation platforms, online neighbourhood communities and so forth. Unlike the physical urban space that it overlays, this new and rapidly emerging virtual space has practically no capacity constraints. However, it is subject to inequalities in terms of access, representation, participation, and ownership. In this research note\textemdash an interdisciplinary collaboration between a computer scientist and an urban planner\textemdash we wish to study the role of wireless technology, which enables the easy deployment of local networks operating outside the public Internet, and the role of the free and open source social software, which facilitates the easy development of customized local applications, allowing citizens to shape their emerging hybrid space. We suggest that this sort of do-it-yourself (DIY) networking can be realised according to citizens' values, objectives and the particularities of the environment, and could ultimately enable them to compete with large ICT corporations such as Google and Facebook for their ``right(s) to the hybrid city''. We employ the urban sidewalk metaphor as an application that is subject to hybrid design and can profit significantly from the special characteristics of DIY networks.

  abstract = {This paper explores the integration of space syntax methodology into the architectural design process. It shows that the use of axial maps and isovists can prepare the groundwork of the design and its influence on the resulting form of the architecture. The key research question is how to directly use space syntax methodology within the design and form finding process. Instead of the space syntax analyst being the consultant to the architect, the architect himself is using the equivalent space syntax tools for developing the design. In the act of designing non-scientific values like intuition, experience and chance play an important role. The usual clear cut between the design work and the scientific analysis of its results (and the consequent feedback) is blurred. Can the axial map, a result of an mathematic calculation, be used for the necessary speculation during the design work? Space Syntax tools like depth map and axial maps are based on visual fields. A axial map can show every possible field of view of a person. The resulting map objectifies what is deeply subjective, that is the way a person experiences space. The paper takes a look at design theory in order to show how architects design. It shows how isovists and axial maps are introduced in that process. It approaches the question of the third dimension in both the design work and the axial maps and shows the resulting architecture in form and space use. The theoretical approach was tested during the work on different architectural projects, four of them are shown in this paper. Two projects are interiors which have been built and two projects are exteriors, they are larger projects which remain unbuild. With each project the approach was altered so as to accommodate experience from the project before. This paper concludes that the trapezoid forms created by the axial maps influence the design directly. Walls, built-in objects and openings accommodate or alter the fields of view. Also interior spaces are better integrated into the exterior. The buildings itself are integrated more harmoniously in the existing fields of view, therefore they are better embedded in the surrounding city scape. Small spaces appear spacious for the user because their fields of view are wider and richer. The interiors which have been built, created a positive feedback from the users.},

These are then calculated for a sample of the main European cities that uses several sources to obtain the best possible dataset to measure urban sprawl.

  abstract = {[spa] 	 El crecimiento desordenado, la exclusi\'on social y los problemas de deterioro medioambientales de las ciudades, se han convertido en algunas de las pautas m\'as discutidas por la sociedad mundial, principalmente, en los \'ultimos 40 a\~nos. En estos debates y acciones se ha puesto de relieve una comprensi\'on com\'un respecto a que dicha realidad es resultado, principalmente del modelo de crecimiento econ\'omico desigual y destructor de la naturaleza, cuyos efectos en el territorio se manifiestan en intensidades y fases distintas de desarrollo, ya sea en los pa\'ises del norte o del sur. Trat\'andose de Brasil, desde la d\'ecada de 1980, se ha puesto en marcha la construcci\'on de nuevas estrategias de gesti\'on urbana y medioambiental, que objetivan revertir los impactos de esa l\'ogica, para promover la inclusi\'on socio-espacial de los segmentos excluidos. Entre esas estrategias, cabe subrayar las que se reflejan en los cambios de las normativas urban\'isticas, principalmente las que se han orientado hacia la democratizaci\'on del acceso al suelo urbano y la gesti\'on de la ciudad. En esto proceso, uno de los principales retos ha sido el desarrollo de acciones que puedan aplicarse a los conflictos socio-ambientales. Entre estos conflictos destacan los que se han generado en los espacios naturales protegidos, debido a la ocupaci\'on inadecuada del suelo, principalmente, para fines residenciales. Estos espacios se han producido, en su mayor\'ia, de forma ilegal desde los \'ambitos urban\'istico y medioambiental, habi\'endose originado a partir de las demandas de las poblaciones m\'as pobres, que no pueden participar del mercado formal tierras. En el \'ambito de la normativa el reto se establece, cuando se busca, en la l\'inea de la justicia socio-ambiental, una conciliaci\'on entre la necesidad de protecci\'on del espacio clasificado como de inter\'es ambiental y el inter\'es social, que est\'a en la ra\'iz de los procesos de apropiaci\'on u ocupaci\'on del suelo referidos. Con este trabajo de investigaci\'on se hace un esfuerzo para comprender dichos procesos desde la perspectiva del planeamiento y de la regulaci\'on, destacando, sobretodo, las estrategias utilizadas por el Estado y la sociedad para poner en marcha los mecanismos de ordenaci\'on territorial y conservaci\'on medioambiental, aplicados al control de la ocupaci\'on del suelo de los asentamientos informales ubicados en los espacios naturales protegidos. En el caso de Natal, se intenta demonstrar que, aunque no exista un comportamiento tipo en el desarrollo de las acciones, algunas referencias se hacen presentes en diferentes etapas del planeamiento urbano y medioambiental del municipio, as\'i como de la pol\'itica de vivienda. Por otra parte, en lo que respecta a las nuevas estrategias de planeamiento e instrumentos de gesti\'on, a pesar de los avances, las dificultades para llevarlas a cabo se mantienen. En esta perspectiva se toman como referencia los \'ultimos Planes Directores (1994 y 2007) y se pone \'enfasis en los procesos de reglamentaci\'on de las Zonas de Protecci\'on Medio Ambiental [ZPAs] y de las \'Areas Especiales de Inter\'es Social [AEIS]. En los an\'alisis de las \'areas de conflictos se subrayan, tambi\'en, las dificultades institucionales para llevar a cabo las acciones de regularizaci\'on urban\'istica y de la tenencia de algunos asentamientos clasificados como AEIS en la categor\'ia favela.},

While all three nations began with a common starting point\textemdash early British town planning legislation\textemdash underlying differences in urban regulation, property rights and housing provision soon emerged. However, signs of convergence have lately re-appeared, as all three countries have responded to affordable housing shortages by exploring new strategies to boost supply through the planning system. In the tradition of comparative housing research, this paper examines these strategies in the context of each country's particular historical, socio-cultural, governance and urban planning frameworks. Our analysis shows how differences in planning systems and approaches to housing assistance can delimit opportunities to secure new affordable homes, particularly in the context of increasing land values. Effective delivery of affordable housing through the planning system depends on consistent and enforceable policy articulation, government commitment, a mature affordable housing sector, and particular market conditions.},

We find evidence at the population level of a `two-speed' process, where - on average - Australians are moving to slightly more advantageous locations, but more vulnerable groups undertake more frequent, multi-step moves to disadvantaged areas. Housing affordability is found to be the key driver of the selective migration of some Australians into less advantaged places.

  abstract = {Societies gain enormous benefits from travel, as economies have become more globalised and as the new communications infrastructure allows international networking and travel at a low cost. There has been a true internationalisation of all activities, and travel forms an essential part of that process. However, this mobility is fuelled by carbon, and there is clear scientific agreement that carbon emissions are affecting the global climate with irreversible long term consequences. Transport is the one sector where a reduction in energy use and emissions is proving to be extraordinarily difficult to achieve despite some success in urban areas. This paper focuses on cities, mobility and climate change, highlighting recent trends in both developed and developing countries. It is argued that the current situation is unsustainable, and that transport must contribute fully to achieving carbon reduction targets. An alternative is presented, based on the sustainable mobility paradigm (Banister, 2008) that looks at ways to reduce the need to travel in cities. The belief that high mobility and technology provides the solution is misplaced, as technological innovation can only get us part of the way to sustainable transport, and this may facilitate more travel. There are opportunities for cities to switch to low carbon transport futures, where vision and action are based on a combination of economic, planning and technological innovations working in mutually supporting ways. Potentially, the future is bright for low carbon transport in cities, but the real question is whether there is the commitment and leadership to follow such a path.},

We start from the premise that form acts on social process (HILLIER; HANSON, 1984),  and verify how much the original spatial configuration of Parque Serrambi housing states  contributed to the creation of new spatial patterns following the interventions of the people living  there. The Serrambi states were built in Natal's south based on an urbanization model following  modernist's principals and aimed to supply demands for popular dwellings. They were one of the  last estates financed by the former National Dwelling Bank (BNH) and supervised by the Dwelling  Cooperatives Orientation Institute (INOCOOP), materialized a spatial form different from the highrise  dwelling experiences from the same period. The results were obtained through  configurational analysis based on Space Syntax conceptual and methodological framework, in  which space and society are viewed as interrelated. The analyses was based on represanting  and quantifying spatial properties and identificatying social patterns related to the interventions.  We identified that the original spatial configurations, associated to subtle changes in the states  social patterns, analysed independently of non-morphological categories, gave way to the  occupation patterns verrified in both Serrambi cases.},

In this article, we report an empirical analysis of more than 200 years (1789\textendash 2010) of the evolution of the street network of Paris. We show that the usual network measures display a smooth behavior and that the most important quantitative signatures of central planning is the spatial reorganization of centrality and the modification of the block shape distribution. Such effects can only be obtained by structural modifications at a large-scale level, with the creation of new roads not constrained by the existing geometry. The evolution of a city thus seems to result from the superimposition of continuous, local growth processes and punctual changes operating at large spatial scales.},

At least one-third of the total rent paid is land rent. Despite increases in real incomes, very-low-income tenants in the Bay Area today have less income remaining after payment of rent than tenants did in 1960. High land rent is a long-term feature of the Bay Area rental market that results mostly from its geography, the density of its urban centers, and a strong economy, rather than from regulatory barriers to new multifamily construction. Deregulation is not a sufficient response to the effects of land rent on low-income tenants. Government should subsidize non-profit housing organizations, particularly land trusts that remove residential land from the market. Taxes on land rent would be a particularly appropriate funding source.},

As such, there are gaps in our knowledge about the landscape of housing regulations, which have particular relevance for understanding barriers to housing affordability and equity. To begin to fill these gaps, I present statistical analyses of building code violations data and housing market data in Chicago. Whereas resolving building violations does increase rents, I find no significant effect on residential sales price. And, although unresolved code violations decrease residential sales price, there is no significant effect on rent prices. Considering these results, I suggest that code violations reinforce the divide between wealthy and poor homeowners and exacerbate the existing lack of affordable housing options for renters. Overall, the article draws attention to the variation in effects of housing regulations in practice. I contend that it is crucial to understand the varied relationships between regulations and the housing market to make a dent in housing inequality.},

  abstract = {Mario Carpo provides a subtle and insightful discussion of the intellectual structures that guide architectural composition and the ways that these structures were transformed by the historic shifts from script to print and from hand-made drawings to mechanically reproduced images. He goes on to suggest that the current shift from print to digital representations will have similarly profound consequences. This is a crucial text for anyone interested in the interrelationships of media and design processes. As urban planning moves from a centralized, top-down approach to a decentralized, bottom-up perspective, our conception of urban systems is changing. In Cities and Complexity, Michael Batty offers a comprehensive view of urban dynamics in the context of complexity theory, presenting models that demonstrate how complexity theory can embrace a myriad of processes and elements that combine into organic wholes. He argues that bottom-up processes--in which the outcomes are always uncertain--can combine with new forms of geometry associated with fractal patterns and chaotic dynamics to provide theories that are applicable to highly complex systems such as cities. Batty begins with models based on cellular automata (CA), simulating urban dynamics through the local actions of automata. He then introduces agent-based models (ABM), in which agents are mobile and move between locations. These models relate to many scales, from the scale of the street to patterns and structure at the scale of the urban region. Finally, Batty develops applications of all these models to specific urban situations, discussing concepts of criticality, threshold, surprise, novelty, and phase transition in the context of spatial developments. Every theory and model presented in the book is developed through examples that range from the simplified and hypothetical to the actual. Deploying extensive visual, mathematical, and textual material, Cities and Complexity will be read both by urban researchers and by complexity theorists with an interest in new kinds of computational models.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Here we define a generic problem of urban design as one in which the planner searches for an optimal location for some development by taking account of a series of potentially conflicting factors, all judged to be essential to the best design. The simplest problem is one where the factors are simply averaged to give the best location for the development but this kind of averaging does not take account of the fact that the factors are of differing importance. We extend the averaging problem to one where each factor is related to every other one with its own set of weights \textendash{} degrees of importance \textendash{} and this sets up a network of relationships between the factors. When these weights are applied in this way, each factor generates a new version of itself which is closer to the final design solution as it is a weighted average of all the other factors to which it is related. Then after this first iteration, the factors become sub-solutions to the problem. Continuing in this way, ultimately this averaging converges to a final solution where all the factors are identical. This process is strongly linked to a network of requirements \textendash{} a social network \textendash{} and although we note this, we simply introduce it as one of several analogies useful to thinking about how we can optimize location. Although we pose this as a design problem, we can turn it on its head and consider it as a problem whose solution is the actual development which we observe but whose factor weights are unknown. The problem then is to figure out how the set of factors can be weighted to generate the observed solution. This can then be treated as an artificial neural net, employing all the ideas that have been developed in the last 50 years about machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). In short, we start with a design problem considered as one of networked averaging and then we reconfigure the problem as one where we observe the actual solution \textendash{} which is the real world \textendash{} and then we figure out how this can occur using a neural network. In this way, we relate how urban development actually occurs to its form as optimal design.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {How we can invent\rule{1em}{1pt}but not predict\rule{1em}{1pt}the future of cities.We cannot predict future cities, but we can invent them. Cities are largely unpredictable because they are complex systems that are more like organisms than machines. Neither the laws of economics nor the laws of mechanics apply; cities are the product of countless individual and collective decisions that do not conform to any grand plan. They are the product of our inventions; they evolve. In Inventing Future Cities, Michael Batty explores what we need to understand about cities in order to invent their future.Batty outlines certain themes\rule{1em}{1pt}principles\rule{1em}{1pt}that apply to all cities. He investigates not the invention of artifacts but inventive processes. Today form is becoming ever more divorced from function; information networks now shape the traditional functions of cities as places of exchange and innovation. By the end of this century, most of the world's population will live in cities, large or small, sometimes contiguous, and always connected; in an urbanized world, it will be increasingly difficult to define a city by its physical boundaries. Batty discusses the coming great transition from a world with few cities to a world of all cities; argues that future cities will be defined as clusters in a hierarchy; describes the future ``high-frequency,'' real-time streaming city; considers urban sprawl and urban renewal; and maps the waves of technological change, which grow ever more intense and lead to continuous innovation\rule{1em}{1pt}an unending process of creative destruction out of which future cities will emerge.},

Despite evidence that on-demand automotive fleets are ripe for electrification, adoption of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in fleet applications has been hindered by lack of charging infrastructure and long charging times. Recent research on electrification programs in Chinese megacities suggests that top-down policy targets can spur investment in charging infrastructure, while intelligent charging coordination can greatly reduce requirements for battery range and infrastructure, as well as revenue losses due to time spent charging. Such capability may require labor policy reform to allow fleet operators to manage their drivers' charging behavior, along with collection and integration of several key data sets including (1) vehicle trajectories and energy consumption, (2) charging infrastructure installation costs, and (3) real-time charging station availability. In turn, digitization enabled by fleet electrification holds the potential to enable a host of smart urban mobility strategies, including integration of public transit with innovative transportation systems and emission-based pricing policies.},

  abstract = {The current revival of the American economy is being predicated on social distancing, specifically the Six-Foot Rule, a guideline that offers little protection from pathogen-bearing aerosol droplets sufficiently small to be continuously mixed through an indoor space. The importance of airborne transmission of COVID-19 is now widely recognized. While tools for risk assessment have recently been developed, no safety guideline has been proposed to protect against it. We here build on models of airborne disease transmission in order to derive an indoor safety guideline that would impose an upper bound on the ``cumulative exposure time,'' the product of the number of occupants and their time in an enclosed space. We demonstrate how this bound depends on the rates of ventilation and air filtration, dimensions of the room, breathing rate, respiratory activity and face mask use of its occupants, and infectiousness of the respiratory aerosols. By synthesizing available data from the best-characterized indoor spreading events with respiratory drop size distributions, we estimate an infectious dose on the order of 10 aerosol-borne virions. The new virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) is thus inferred to be an order of magnitude more infectious than its forerunner (SARS-CoV), consistent with the pandemic status achieved by COVID-19. Case studies are presented for classrooms and nursing homes, and a spreadsheet and online app are provided to facilitate use of our guideline. Implications for contact tracing and quarantining are considered, and appropriate caveats enumerated. Particular consideration is given to respiratory jets, which may substantially elevate risk when face masks are not worn.},

Recent attention to biophilic design among architects and designers acknowledges this power of nature. However, in an increasingly urban planet, more attention needs to be aimed at the urban scales, at planning for and moving towards what the authors call ``biophilic cities''. Biophilic cities are cities that provide close and daily contact with nature, nearby nature, but also seek to foster an awareness of and caring for this nature. Biophilic cities, it is argued here, are also sustainable and resilient cities. Achieving the conditions of a biophilic city will go far in helping to foster social and landscape resilience, in the face of climate change, natural disasters and economic uncertainty and various other shocks that cities will face in the future. The paper identifies key pathways by which biophilic urbanism enhances resilience, and while some are well-established relationships, others are more tentative and suggest future research and testing.},

Some kind of intensification of residential land uses will undoubtedly need to be part of the strategy for increasing the supply of housing in the city, but questions remain about how this intensification should be carried out. This report compares the built form of Vancouver's low-density, single-family communities to older and more established neighbourhoods in cities in both North America and Europe. The purpose of this exercise is to understand how the built form of the city, such as the street patterns and types of buildings, affect the level of density. This report finds that there is a significant amount of land in Vancouver that could be redeveloped to meet future housing needs.},

Economists and other experts who favor increases in supply have failed to take these supply skeptics seriously. But left unanswered, supply skepticism is likely to continue to feed local opposition to housing construction, and further increase the prevalence and intensity of land-use regulations that limit construction. This article is meant to bridge the divide, addressing each of the key arguments supply skeptics make and reviewing what research has shown about housing supply and its effect on affordability. We ultimately conclude, from both theory and empirical evidence, that adding new homes moderates price increases and therefore makes housing more affordable to low- and moderate-income families. We argue further that there are additional reasons to be concerned about inadequate supply response and assess the evidence on those effects of limiting supply, including preventing workers from moving to areas with growing job opportunities. Finally, we conclude by emphasizing that new market-rate housing is necessary but not sufficient. Government intervention is critical to ensure that supply is added at prices affordable to a range of incomes.},

The same standards for subdividing land, grading, laying streets and utilities, and configuring rights-of-way and street widths to accommodate cars (rather than pedestrians) have been adopted in many areas of the world regardless of variations in local environments. In The Code of the City,Eran Ben-Joseph examines the relationship between standards and place making. He traces the evolution of codes and standards and analyzes their impact on the modern city and its suburbs, arguing that it is time for development regulations to reflect site-specific and localized physical design.Standards and codes were meant to bring order and safety to the city building process. But now, Ben-Joseph argues, these accumulated rules and their widespread application illustrate a disconnect between the original rationale for their existence and their actual effect on the natural and human environment. To discover how this separation of codes from local conditions came about, he looks at the origins of urban standards and their use, from early civilization through the rapid urbanization of the nineteenth century. He provides examples that demonstrate how standards have shaped residential developments and reshaped the natural landscape. And he considers alternatives for the future\rule{1em}{1pt}innovation and de facto deregulation by private developers, new design technologies, and place-based regulations reflecting local conditions. Standards, writes Ben-Joseph, will continue to shape the built environment, but they must be flexible enough to allow for innovation and contribute to the development of sustainable and desirable communities.},

  abstract = {When modeling geo-spatial data, it is critical to capture spatial correlations for achieving high accuracy. Spatial Auto-Regression (SAR) is a common tool used to model such data, where the spatial contiguity matrix (W) encodes thespatial correlations. However, the efficacy of SAR is limited by two factors. First, it depends on the choice of contiguity matrix, which is typically not learnt from data, but instead, is assumed to be known apriori. Second, it assumes that the observations can be explained by linear models. In this paper, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework to model geo-spatial data (specifically housing prices), to learn the spatial correlations automatically. We show that neighborhood information embedded in satellite imagery can be leveraged to achieve the desired spatial smoothing. An additional upside of our framework is the relaxation of linear assumption on the data. Specific challenges we tackle while implementing our framework include, (i) how much of the neighborhood is relevant while estimating housing prices? (ii) what is the right approach to capture multiple resolutions of satellite imagery? and (iii) what other data-sources can help improve the estimation of spatial correlations? We demonstrate a marked improvement of 57\% on top of the SAR baseline through the use of features from deep neural networks for the cities of London, Birmingham and Liverpool.},

The main idea of our paper is that a city cannot be meaningfully simulated without taking its neighbourhood into account. A simple traffic simulation that considers this neighbourhood is then used to grow new major roads and to influence the locations of minor road growth. Waterways are introduced and used to help position the city nuclei on the map. The resulting cities are formed by allowing several smaller settlements to grow together and to form a rich road structure, much like in real world, and require only minimal per-city input, allowing for batch generation.},

  abstract = {Background Poor housing affordability affects around 10\% of the Australian population and is increasingly prevalent. The authors tested two hypotheses: that cumulative exposure to housing affordability stress (HAS) is associated with poorer mental health and that effects vary by gender. Methods The authors estimated the relationship between cumulative exposure to HAS and mental health among 15 478 participants in an Australian longitudinal survey between 2001 and 2009. Individuals were classified as being in HAS if household income was in the lowest 40\% of the national distribution and housing costs exceeded 30\% of income. Exposure to HAS ranged from 1 to 8 annual waves. Mental health was measured using the Short Form 36 Mental Component Summary (MCS) score. To test the extent to which any observed associations were explained by compositional factors, random- and fixed-effects models were estimated. Results In the random-effects models, mental health scores decreased with increasing cumulative exposure to HAS (up until 4+ years). This relationship differed by gender, with a stronger dose-response observed among men. The mean MCS score of men experiencing four to eight waves of housing stress was 2.02 points lower than men not in HAS (95\% CI -3.89 to -0.16). In the fixed-effects models, there was no evidence of a cumulative effect of HAS on mental health; however, lower MCS was observed after a single year in HAS ({$\beta$}=-0.70, 95\% CI -1.02 to -0.37). Conclusions While average mental health was lower for individuals with longer exposure to HAS, the mental health effect appears to be due to compositional factors. Furthermore, men and women appear to experience cumulative HAS differently.},

A time based quality of life index was administered to matched households of differing block size, location and suburban housing density. People were asked to estimate their current weekly time allocation and how they would like it to change. Willingness to pay for such a change was assessed within the constraints of current income. It was found that housing type and location did not affect perceived quality of life as measured by this time based indicator.

  abstract = {This paper surveys the theoretical and empirical research on the relationship between local taxation, land use regulation and land use patterns. The findings can be summarized as follows: 1) In more fiscally decentralized settings, sub-national land use regulation and fiscal policies encourage urban sprawl. In contrast, in more centralized settings, restrictive urban containment policies and a lack of local fiscal incentives for land development tend to generate housing shortages. 2) Certain fiscal instruments affect the type and composition of land development, e.g. the share of residential versus commercial development. Removing local fiscal incentives for certain property types reduces the amount of land allocated for that type and increases its price. 3) In more decentralized settings, local land use policies aimed at containing or modifying urban growth are ineffective since mobile individuals can circumvent local restrictions by sorting into nearby jurisdictions that offer the preferred combination of land consumption and public services. 4) Expanding transportation networks enables households and firms to move to suburban areas, prompting the central city population to shrink and encouraging sprawl, particularly near major highways. 5) In fiscally decentralized settings, sub-urbanization is associated with a growing political power of homeowners. Homeowners tend to get fiscal zoning policies enacted \textendash{} mainly via minimum lot size restrictions \textendash{} that selectively attract well-off local taxpayers. Fiscal zoning thus imposes barriers to local development and raises property values, while at the same time facilitating sprawl. Overall, fiscal policy and land use regulation strongly interact, and governments must align those policies carefully to achieve land-use objectives effectively.},

While still partaking fewer and shorter trips than younger generations, today's elderly have been found increasingly (auto)mobile. Although the elderly benefit from the independence, freedom of movement, and social inclusion, concerns may rise regarding the environmental and accessibility impacts of this induced mobility. The present study adds to the expanding literature on elderly mobility, an integrated analysis of the effects of socio-demographic, health, trip, spatial and weather attributes on elderly mobility. Utilizing travel diary data for Greater Rotterdam, The Netherlands, trip frequencies and transport mode choices of the elderly are analysed by means of zero-inflated negative binomial models as well as multinomial logit regression models, and contrasted to the non-elderly subpopulation to explore (dis)similarities. While the results show common determinants, the models also highlight important differences in the magnitude of the estimated coefficients and factors only influencing transport patterns for the elderly. Embedded in the context of an aging population, the empirical findings assist policy-makers and planners in several respects: For transportation plans and programs it is critical to recognize mobility needs of the elderly. As the seniors are becoming increasingly automobile, the results call for strategies to encourage older people to use more physically active and environmentally friendly transport modes such as public transport, walking and cycling.},

This paper develops a typology of measures and indicators for assessing the physical complexity of the built environment at the scale of urban design. It extends quantitative measures from city planning, network science, ecosystems studies, fractal geometry, statistical physics, and information theory to the analysis of urban form and qualitative human experience. Metrics at multiple scales are scattered throughout diverse bodies of literature and have useful applications in analyzing the adaptive complexity that both evolves and results from local design processes. In turn, they enable urban designers to assess resilience, adaptability, connectedness, and livability with an advanced toolkit. The typology developed here applies to empirical research of various neighborhood types and design standards. It includes temporal, visual, spatial, scaling, and connectivity measures of the urban form. Today, prominent urban design movements openly embrace complexity but must move beyond inspiration and metaphor to formalize what ``complexity'' is and how we can use it to assess both the world as-is as well as proposals for how it could be instead.},

  abstract = {As the rental housing market moves online, the internet offers divergent possible futures: either the promise of more-equal access to information for previously marginalized homeseekers, or a reproduction of longstanding information inequalities. Biases in online listings' representativeness could impact different communities' access to housing search information, reinforcing traditional information segregation patterns through a digital divide. They could also circumscribe housing practitioners' and researchers' ability to draw broad market insights from listings to understand rental supply and affordability. This study examines millions of Craigslist rental listings across the USA and finds that they spatially concentrate and overrepresent whiter, wealthier, and better-educated communities. Other significant demographic differences exist in age, language, college enrollment, rent, poverty rate, and household size. Most cities' online housing markets are digitally segregated by race and class, and we discuss various implications for residential mobility, community legibility, gentrification, housing voucher utilization, and automated monitoring and analytics in the smart cities paradigm. While Craigslist contains valuable crowdsourced data to better understand affordability and available rental supply in real time, it does not evenly represent all market segments. The internet promises information democratization, and online listings can reduce housing search costs and increase choice sets. However, technology access/preferences and information channel segregation can concentrate such information-broadcasting benefits in already-advantaged communities, reproducing traditional inequalities and reinforcing residential sorting and segregation dynamics. Technology platforms like Craigslist construct new institutions with the power to shape spatial economies, human interactions, and planners' ability to monitor and respond to urban challenges.},

Classic urban form visualizations \textendash{} from Giambattista Nolli's ichnographic maps of Rome to Allan Jacobs's figure-ground diagrams of city streets \textendash{} have compressed physical urban complexity into easily comprehensible information artifacts. Today we can enhance these traditional workflows through the Smart Cities paradigm of understanding cities via user-generated content and harvested data in an information management context. New spatial technology platforms and big data offer new lenses to understand, evaluate, monitor, and manage urban form and evolution. This paper builds on the theoretical framework of visual cultures in urban planning and morphology to introduce and situate computational data science processes for exploring urban fabric patterns and spatial order. It demonstrates these workflows with OSMnx and data from OpenStreetMap, a collaborative spatial information system and mapping platform, to examine street network patterns, orientations, and configurations in different study sites around the world, considering what these reveal about the urban fabric. The age of ubiquitous urban data and computational toolkits opens up a new era of worldwide urban form analysis from integrated quantitative and qualitative perspectives.},

Measures of entropy reveal a city's streets' order and disorder. Past studies have explored individual cases of orientation and entropy, but little is known about broader patterns and trends worldwide. This study examines street network orientation, configuration, and entropy in 100 cities around the world using OpenStreetMap data and OSMnx. It measures the entropy of street bearings in weighted and unweighted network models, along with each city's typical street segment length, average circuity, average node degree, and the network's proportions of four-way intersections and dead-ends. It also develops a new indicator of orientation-order that quantifies how a city's street network follows the geometric ordering logic of a single grid. A cluster analysis is performed to explore similarities and differences among these study sites in multiple dimensions. Significant statistical relationships exist between city orientation-order and other indicators of spatial order, including street circuity and measures of connectedness. On average, US/Canadian study sites are far more grid-like than those elsewhere, exhibiting less entropy and circuity. These indicators, taken in concert, help reveal the extent and nuance of the grid. These methods demonstrate automatic, scalable, reproducible tools to empirically measure and visualize city spatial order, illustrating complex urban transportation system patterns and configurations around the world.},

It has been implemented successful in several large North and South American cities. Its transposition to Europe and small to medium cities is not straightforward, especially because European cities are much more dense than American ones, and transit is already well developed. However, TOD can also be considered as a means to coordinate existing land use and transport planning, and this is a major issue for all cities whatever their size or their density. Indeed, there is a co-production relationship between transport and land use, and the city development is systemic with many feedback loops between its subsystems. We show in this paper that a medium-sized city such as Besan\c{c}on in France can benefit from a TOD approach for its development by designing scenarios and evaluating hem with a LUTI model.},

In this article, we therefore introduce the notion of self-organization, referring to initiatives that originate in civil society itself, via autonomous community-based networks of citizens outside government control which participate in developing the `urban fabric' too. We discuss some examples of self-organization and draw preliminary conclusions of the concept's usefulness for the theory and practice of spatial planning.},

We introduce an energy budget to the agents of a swarm system, and show how mapping the energy level to visual information such as line width or color, combined with mechanisms such as resource chasing and consumption, enriches the search space of possible images. Moreover, we highlight that the approach allows the user to partially control the creation process of the drawings. We argue that the exploration of ecosystem dynamics in generative systems may open up novel artistic opportunities and shift the perspective from swarm art toward ecosystem art.},

The US estimates imply large bubbles on its two coasts, but not inland, and the Australian and Swedish estimates imply insigni cant and modest bubbles, respectively. The results of the present work for three New Zealand cities are most similar to those for Swedish cities. Like evidence from the other countries, real income (employment and the real wage rate), real construction costs, and the real after-tax interest rate all matter. While the estimation methodology is similar to an error correction model, it is believed to be a superior method when the data time series is short. In any event, tests for house price bubbles would seem to be necessary in house price research.},

We contend that some studies report a spurious effect of walkability because of differences between areas with high and low walkability. Methods We replicate the positive effect of walkability on prices for single-family homes and condominiums in Miami, Florida, using a unique data set of house values and characteristics. We employ a fixed effects regression model instead of a traditional ordinary least squares regression model to account for the unobserved heterogeneity of neighborhoods. Results We find that walkability's impact on housing value becomes statistically insignificant at the margin after controlling for heteroscedasticity and neighborhood fixed effects. Conclusions The significant impact of the fixed effects suggests that something other than walkability is affecting prices and that better specified models are needed to discern the real price effects of walkability.},

Governments commonly give rental subsidies to poor households, but it is not known whether or to what extent this distorts underlying property prices. Using a difference-in-differences-type estimator to exploit variation in scale of the cuts across local areas, we find that the cuts lowered house prices from the time of the policy announcement. The impact was seen predominantly for types of property typically rented by recipients of subsidies and in areas where demand for housing is low relative to supply. Analysis of survey data of individuals finds that benefit recipients were more likely to move home after the cuts relative to other renters. Overall, the results suggest that rental subsidies, while helping recipients to afford otherwise too expensive properties, could contribute to affordability problems for buyers.},

Housing affordability became a more significant policy issue when the impact on the normal functioning of the owner occupier market became severe and when the macro-economic feedback effects were perceived as serious. A number of specific policy changes resulted from this crisis, some of which may prove to be enduring.},

  doi = {10.14288/1.0086997},
  abstract = {This thesis examines the changing role of British Columbia's municipal governments in affordable housing policy. In recent years, the federal government of Canada has withdrawn from active involvement in affordable housing provision, and has passed responsibility back to the provinces. The government of British Columbia has, in turn, amended its Municipal Act through Bills 20 (1992), 57 (1993) and 31 (1994), to grant municipal governments increased planning powers in the field of affordable housing. This thesis examines the responses of municipal governments to these changes and specifically investigates whether the decentralization of responsibility has to led to policy innovation. This research question is addressed in three ways. First, through a review of the theoretical literature and legislation, a discussion is presented concerning the issue of decentralization and the ways it has been enacted in the case of housing policy in British Columbia. Secondly, the results of a postal survey of 52 municipalities in British Columbia are presented, reflecting the range of local responses to the provincial housing legislation. Thirdly, case studies, derived from key informant interviews and document analysis in three municipalities (Burnaby, Sidney and Prince George) are presented. These provide more detailed illustrations of housing strategies in different geographical contexts. The research suggests that housing is a dynamic area of public policy in British Columbia, with a distinct pattern of innovation. In particular, some 'entrepreneurial' municipalities exhibited a shorter response time in reacting to the provincial legislation, and have adopted more innovative approaches to housing policy; these in turn, serve as examples to other jurisdictions. The wide range of innovative housing strategies adopted by local governments across the province, which are highlighted in this thesis, suggest that decentralization has ensured the potential for a greater fit between the preferences and needs of a particular locale. To the extent that it provides municipalities with the powers and resources they need, the decentralization policy allows communities to capitalize on their existing strengths and to more readily meet their housing needs.},

The evaluation tools that were examined include cost-benefit analysis (CBA), cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). It was concluded that both CEA and CBA are useful for estimating the costs and/or benefits associated with transport policies but are constrained by the difficulty in quantifying non-market impacts and monetising total costs and benefits. Furthermore, CEA is limited to identifying the most `cost-effective policy' for achieving a single, narrowly defined objective, usually greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction and is, therefore, not suitable for evaluating policy options with ancillary costs or a variety of potential benefits. Thus, CBA or CEA evaluation should be complemented by a complete environmental and socio-economic impact assessment approach such as MCDA. This method allows for participatory analysis and qualitative assessment but is subject to caveats such as subjectivity and value-laden judgments.},

In the last several decades, however, financing of growth has increasingly relied on land-use exactions, where new residents pay for the cost of incremental infrastructure.

To provide such an analysis, this paper investigates three different schemes for financing incremental infrastructure within an urban growth model. The analysis compares an impact-fee scheme to two types of cost-sharing schemes, deriving the effects on urban growth and land values of switching to the impact-fee scheme.

Revealed- and stated-route-choice studies indicate that intersections have negative effects on the cycling experience, but that certain features can offset this.

In spite of an increase in studies and general agreement among findings, several important research gaps remain, including empirical studies using comprehensive network measures and studies of specific facility designs and new types of facilities (including intersection treatments). Improved research methods are necessary, including better sampling, longitudinal studies, greater geographic diversity, and incorporating more control variables, including policies.},

To examine the role of cycling facilities, we used a newly assembled dataset on the length of bike lanes and paths in 2008 collected directly from 90 of the 100 largest U.S. cities. Pearson's correlation, bivariate quartile analysis, and two different types of regressions were used to measure the relationship between cycling levels and bikeways, as well as other explanatory and control variables. Ordinary Least Squares and Binary Logit Proportions regressions confirm that cities with a greater supply of bike paths and lanes have significantly higher bike commute rates\textemdash even when controlling for land use, climate, socioeconomic factors, gasoline prices, public transport supply, and cycling safety. Standard tests indicate that the models are a good fit, with R 2 ranging between 0.60 and 0.65. Computed coefficients have the expected signs for all variables in the various regression models, but not all are statistically significant. Estimated elasticities indicate that both off-street paths and on-street lanes have a similar positive association with bike commute rates in U.S. cities. Our results are consistent with previous research on the importance of separate cycling facilities and provide additional information about the potentially different role of paths vs. lanes. Our analysis also revealed that cities with safer cycling, lower auto ownership, more students, less sprawl, and higher gasoline prices had more cycling to work. By comparison, annual precipitation, the number of cold and hot days, and public transport supply were not statistically significant predictors of bike commuting in large cities.},

  abstract = {Highly productive U.S. cities are characterized by high housing prices, low housing stock growth, and restrictive land-use regulations (e.g., San Francisco). While new residents would benefit from housing stock growth in cities with highly productive firms, existing residents justify strict local land-use regulations on the grounds of congestion and other costs of further development. This paper assesses the welfare implications of these local regulations for income, congestion, and urban sprawl within a general-equilibrium model with endogenous regulation. In the model, households choose from locations that vary exogenously by productivity and endogenously according to local externalities of congestion and sharing. Existing residents address these externalities by voting for regulations that limit local housing density. In equilibrium, these regulations bind and house prices compensate for differences across locations. Relative to the planner's optimum, the decentralized model generates spatial misallocation whereby high-productivity locations are settled at too-low densities. The model admits a straightforward calibration based on observed population density, expenditure shares on consumption and local services, and local incomes. Welfare and output would be 1.4\% and 2.1\% higher, respectively, under the planner's allocation. Abolishing zoning regulations entirely would increase GDP by 6\%, but lower welfare by 5.9\% because of greater congestion.},

  abstract = {Housing in-affordability is a growing problem within Canadian urban areas. This research asks an as-yet unanswered spatial question: where do those suffering high rates of housing affordability stress reside and what do the spatial patterns imply about policies intended to address this housing problem? This paper tabulates and maps the spatial distribution of households that pay excessive amounts of their income for rent in order to identify locations within metropolitan regions where housing affordability stress is greatest. It is found that significant unevenness characterises the spatial distribution of housing affordability problems in major Canadian census metropolitan areas (CMAs). Only a minority of places conform to the North American stereotype that concentrates this problem near the city centre. Where some CMAs have concentrations of the problem in the inner city or, alternatively inner suburb, other metropolitan areas exhibit a more diffuse pattern of housing in-affordability. The locus of the problem is also variable depending on whether the household is of the family or non-family type. The interpretation of the uneven patterns relates broadly to features of supply and demand that have been identified in previous research. From both a policy and theoretical perspective this work demonstrates that greater attention needs to be paid to the spatial aspects of housing affordability and to the related, economically-induced risk of homelessness in Canadian metropolitan areas.},

In part, this is due to the persistence of what appear to be two analytically distinct approaches in understanding and measuring polycentricity: a morphological approach centring on nodal features and a functional approach focused on the relations between centres. Informed by the oft-overlooked but rich heritage of urban systems research, this paper presents a general theoretical framework that links both approaches and discusses the way both can be measured and compared in a coherent manner. Using the Netherlands as a test case, it is demonstrated that most regions tend to be more morphologically polycentric than functionally polycentric. The difference is largely explained by the size, external connectivity and degree of self-sufficiency of a region's principal centre.},

The central proposition                                   is that parametric modelling software is invaluable for                                   both preliminary and developed design where there is                                   a need for the definition, manipulation and                                   visualisation of complex geometry. The paper begins                                   with a definition of 'parametric design' followed by a                                   consideration of its potential to assist or hinder the                                   designer. A worked example will demonstrate how the                                   elements that make up a model can be referenced to                                   each other using a number of clearly defined                                   constraints, the completed model being changed,                                   modified and regenerated while conforming to pre-set                                   conditions.

The model, which operates in a top-down manner, can be described at three levels. At the first level, a vocabulary for an architectural language of row-houses is formed by analysing this type of house syntactically and formally. At the second level, this vocabulary is transformed into a shape grammar. Finally, a syntactic system is defined as a space of possible designs according to these analyses. An interface design has been carried out to facilitate the communication between the users and the model during the design process.},

  abstract = {Measuring housing affordability is a key challenge for most communities. Traditionally, the 30 percent rent-income ratio has been the cornerstone of housing affordability policies. Recently, however, a number of researchers have recommended new affordability measures. Given the complexity of determining realistic housing affordability, identifying the best and most appropriate measure is a challenge. This thesis is the first research attempt to develop a comprehensive methodological framework for the comparative assessment of commonly used housing affordability indicators. Six housing affordability measures were selected for analysis: NAR Housing Affordability Index, HUD Guideline, Amenity-Based Housing Affordability Index, H+T Affordability Index, Shelter Poverty Measure, and Self-Sufficiency Standard. These measures were compared in terms of their underlying standards, data accuracy, and comprehensiveness. Specific indicators for each of the three components were developed and applied to the six housing affordability indicators. Detailed analysis of the collected data revealed that the Self-Sufficiency Standard measure is the best measure of housing affordability among the six indicators analyzed. This measure outranks each of the other measures on all three dimensions of comparison. Therefore, it is recommended that local planners, stakeholders, and policymakers adopt the Self-Sufficiency Standard to assess housing affordability outcomes.},

It introduces a Generative Design System that draws on evolutionary concepts to incorporate adaptation paradigms into the architectural design process. The initial aim of the project focused on helping architects improving the environmental performance of buildings, but the final conclusions of the thesis transcend this realm to question the process of incorporating computational generative systems in the broader context of architectural design. The Generative System [GS] uses a Genetic Algorithm as the search and optimization engine. The evaluation of solutions in terms of environmental performance is done using DOE2.1E. The GS is first tested within a restricted domain, where the optimal solution is previously known, to allow for the evaluation of the system's performance in locating high quality solutions. Results are very satisfactory and provide confidence to extend the GS to complex building layouts. Comparative studies using other heuristic search procedures like Simulated Annealing are also performed. The GS is then applied to an existing building by Alvaro Siza, to study the system's behavior in a complex architectural domain, and to assess its capability for encoding language constraints, so that solutions generated may be within certain design intentions. An extension to multicriteria problems is presented, using a Pareto-based method.},

Despite being one of the most commonly used normative concepts in urban design, coherence still lacks a firm morphological definition. Without an explicit specification of its spatial attributes, coherence remains a vague and subjective notion of design implicitly referred to as one of the basic properties of good urban form. As a contribution to the link between urban design and morphology, this paper renders the normative concept objectively in terms of a set of quantifiable morphological indicators. Spatial proximity and consistency are suggested as the two key indicators for measuring the coherence of urban fabric. Based on the computational theory of coherence, originally put forward by Thagard, an analytical model is suggested to quantify the morphological coherence of actual urban fabrics. In this framework, three planned neighbourhoods in Rotterdam, the Netherlands are analysed to illustrate the changing nature of morphological coherence through different fashions of urbanism initiated in different periods of time.},

The present study aims at establishing, in the metropolitan area of Milan, whether different patterns of urban expansion could be associated with specific environmental costs\textemdash in particular, for land consumption and mobility generation. Different typologies of urban expansion were defined, and an impact index weighting differently journey-to-work trips with reference to mode and time length was built at the municipality level. The statistical analysis confirmed the expected ``wasteful'' character of sprawling development patterns in terms of land consumption, though suggesting that recent urban development is becoming relatively `virtuous' with respect to the past. With reference to the mobility generated, higher environmental impacts were proved to be associated with low densities, sprawling development, more recent urbanisation processes and residential specialisation of the single municipalities. Public transport seems to be strongly influenced, both in terms of efficiency and competitiveness, by the structural organisation of an urban area: the more dispersed and less structured the development, the lower its level of efficiency and competitiveness and consequently its share of the mobility market. On the contrary, trip times for private transport appear to be correlated not so much to urban dimension or density as to the presence of recent housing development, indicating the emergence of new models of lifestyle and mobility which are very different from those of the past.},

Interviews were conducted with rental providers and other stakeholders, using snowball sampling methods, which were supported by secondary data.     Research findings revealed that rented condominiums are highly significant in the City, given the gradual decline of the purpose built rental stock. However, an increased reliance on rented condominiums is problematic because this supply exists solely for investment purposes and there are some concerns regarding housing affordability. Furthermore, challenges faced by rented condominium providers could affect the supply of this stock. These include rent control and rental restrictions, which are regulated by provincial legislations. Minor amendments to these legislations are suggested to increase the supply. However, there are risks involved in adopting policies that encourage rented condominiums such as an unstable supply and difficulties in securing the stock.  To secure rental housing affordability and adequate rental housing for renters in the City, policies focusing on increasing the supply of purpose built rental housing are recommended, in addition to comprehensive research on the rental housing sector. Strong emphasis is placed on supportive federal government policies, improved partnerships among all levels of government and a collaborative approach between government and rental providers in solving the rental housing shortage in the City.},

  abstract = {What are the drivers of urban transformation, including microeconomic diversity and growth? And what could refrain transformation? The city of Rio de Janeiro received 218 developments of the Brazilian Public Housing Programme "Minha Casa Minha Vida" (PMCMV) in the last five years, mostly located in peripheral areas. Recurring criticism has been made to the programme in relation to size and locations of projects, along with a lack of urban diversity and infrastructure. Confronting assumptions latent in such criticism, this paper develops a methodology to assess (1) the degree of microeconomic support that the built environment offers to residents; (2) the morphological and functional interfaces of new housing complexes and their neighbourhood; and (3) the impacts these complexes have on the economic diversity of their surroundings. In a first empirical study, social and spatial attributes of areas around twelve housing complex in areas of different levels of topological accessibility and building density were compared, including pedestrian movement, distribution of retail and services, and an index of diversity in urban activities based on Shannon's entropy. A second empirical study analyses variations in land use and land parcelling in West Rio, from 2011 to 2015. Assessing the impact of housing complexes on the microeconomic diversity, this approach identifies divergences between patterns of accessibility, and patterns of location of housing compounds and activities. Results indicate (i) substantial differences in topological and absolute distances to the CBD; (ii) strong influences of accessibility in the morphological and microeconomic integration between housing complexes and their neighbourhoods; and (iii) significant influence of land subdivision on the rate of change of land uses in areas of sprawl.},

  abstract = {Urbanisation, environmental risks and resource scarcity are but three of many challenges that cities must address if they are to become more sustainable. However, the policies and spatial development strategies implemented to achieve individual sustainability objectives frequently interact and conflict presenting decision-makers a multi-objective spatial optimisation problem. This work presents a developed spatial optimisation framework which optimises the location of future residential development against several sustainability objectives. The framework is applied to a case study over Middlesbrough in the North East of the United Kingdom. In this context, the framework optimises five sustainability objectives from our case study site: (i) minimising risk from heat waves, (ii) minimising the risk from flood events, (iii) minimising travel costs to minimise transport emissions, (iv) minimising the expansion of urban sprawl and (v) preventing development on green-spaces. A series of optimised spatial configurations of future development strategies are presented. The results compare strategies that are optimal against individual, pairs and multiple sustainability objectives, such that each of these optimal strategies out-performs all other development strategies in at least one sustainability objective. Moreover, the resulting spatial strategies significantly outperform the current local authority strategy for all objectives with, for example, a relative improvement of up to 68\% in the performance of distance to CBD. Based on these results, it suggests that spatial optimisation can provide a powerful decision support tool to help planners to identify spatial development strategies that satisfy multiple sustainability objectives.},

  abstract = {Self-build is lately attracting much interest as a solution to housing supply that can complement the insufficient delivery of housebuilding by the construction industry. The historical trajectory of self-build shows that from a practice which had a conflictual stance towards central authority in the past, it is now promoted by the same authority within a framework of empowerment of and central power devolution to local communities. Against this backdrop, the challenge is to preserve the spirit of independence that still pervades self-build and yet merge it with the planning frameworks which are used to control development generally. This approach has recently been experimented with by some large-scale self-build projects. Through literature review, this article firstly identifies important values that motivate self-builders; secondly it recognizes rule-based, rather than prescriptive codes such as generative codes, as those that can facilitate autonomy within a loose form of control; and finally it develops case studies that help understand how such values have been interpreted in different ways, reflecting the context. Elaborating on case studies, the discussion section outlines how values can inform different types of generative codes while increasing participation and an enhanced democracy of the planning process.},

It focuses on destination walking and self-reported health, and does so at the neighborhood scale. The built environment, in particular sidewalks, road connectivity, and proximity of local destinations, correlates with destination walking, and similarly destination walking correlates with physical health. It was found, however, that the built environment and health metrics may not be simply, directly correlated but rather may be correlated through a series of feedback loops that may regulate risk in different ways in different contexts. In particular, evidence for a feedback loop between physical health and destination walking is observed, as well as separate feedback loops between destination walking and objective metrics of the built environment, and destination walking and perception of the built environment. These feedback loops affect the ability to observe how the built environment correlates with residents' physical health. Previous studies have investigated pieces of these associations, but are potentially missing the more complex relationships present. This study proposes a conceptual model describing complex feedback relationships between destination walking and public health, with the built environment expected to increase or decrease the strength of the feedback loop. Evidence supporting these feedback relationships is presented.},

  doi = {10.14288/1.0086205},
  abstract = {Urban areas such as the City of Vancouver offer employment opportunities and living amenities that are attractive to other Canadians and immigrants. The result is a rate of growth that exceeds the national average. It is the responsibility of the elected representatives to implement public policy that will provide housing for these new residents. As the amount of available land diminishes, increased density plays a more significant role. The purpose of this paper is to determine how, if any, increased density impacts the value of adjacent properties. It has been argued by individuals and local area interest groups that property values will decline if increased density residential development is allowed to occur in their neighborhoods. One such neighborhood, the Kitsilano neighborhood in Vancouver's west side, is undergoing a rezoning from light industrial to higher density residential relative to the adjacent neighboring properties. Using a statistical procedure known as hedonic modelling, the results indicate that the rezoning has had no impact on property values. This could result from the fact that the rezoning indeed has no effect on property values as is evidenced by a great deal of the literature on the subject. However, the model may be mis-specified and these results may be interpreted in a number of other ways. For instance, the rezoning studied in this paper has two components. The area is experiencing a land-use change from light industrial to residential which theoretically ought to increase property values in a predominantly residential neighborhood. The second component involves the proposed increased density relative to the existing neighborhood with an anticipated negative effect. The results of these two forces may be cancelling each other out in the empirical model.},

This paper investigated the drivers of variation using a mixed-methods approach including a two-stage Heckman model, a survey of Texas subdivision developers and interviews with local planning officials. Results indicate that initial public funding may lead to more LEED-ND projects being completed, but with a diminishing return as these projects become established within the region. Support for local programs including tax abatement, public-private partnerships, and other incentives were also demonstrated to help facilitate LEED-ND project adoption. Overall this paper underscored the important role, especially early on, the public sector and local governments play in initiating local LEED-ND projects to inform and motivate the land development industry.},

  abstract = {The built environment is thought to influence travel demand along three principal dimensions -density, diversity, and design. This paper tests this proposition by examining how the '3Ds' affect trip rates and mode choice of residents in the San Francisco Bay Area. Using 1990 travel diary data and land-use records obtained from the U.S. census, regional inventories, and field surveys, models are estimated that relate features of the built environment to variations in vehicle miles traveled per household and mode choice, mainly for non-work trips. Factor analysis is used to linearly combine variables into the density and design dimensions of the built environment. The research finds that density, land-use diversity, and pedestrian-oriented designs generally reduce trip rates and encourage non-auto travel in statistically significant ways, though their influences appear to be fairly marginal. Elasticities between variables and factors that capture the 3Ds and various measures of travel demand are generally in the 0.06 to 0.18 range, expressed in absolute terms. Compact development was found to exert the strongest influence on personal business trips. Within-neighborhood retail shops, on the other hand, were most strongly associated with mode choice for work trips. And while a factor capturing 'walking quality' was only moderately related to mode choice for non-work trips, those living in neighborhoods with grid-iron street designs and restricted commercial parking were nonetheless found to average significantly less vehicle miles of travel and rely less on single-occupant vehicles for non-work trips. Overall, this research shows that the elasticities between each dimension of the built environment and travel demand are modest to moderate, though certainly not inconsequential. Thus it supports the contention of new urbanists and others that creating more compact, diverse, and pedestrian-orientated neighborhoods, in combination, can meaningfully influence how Americans travel. \textcopyright{} 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

It is argued that the principle of productivity, which is the essence of management, is equally applicable in urban management at various levels, to achieve the goals in the urban sector and of the urban organizations, ensuring efficient use of resources which are scarce quantities. Some techniques of urban management to improve productivity are discussed and two optimizing urban development models are presented which can be used as tools to improve productivity at the urban development project level.

  abstract = {For the past two decades, extensive research has been conducted to evaluate the performance of urban form scenarios such as sky view factors, solar radiation, or energy performance. Simulation-based performance analysis has been applied for optimizing urban design using multiple performance criteria of energy demands, daylighting, or radiance. Two major limitations exist in the performance evaluation methods of urban design: 1) the number of urban design alternatives or scenarios has been limited, and 2) various performance criteria and metrics have not been assessed synthetically. In this respect, we aim to generate all possible alternatives under constraints such as a city policy or development requirements. This paper addresses the integration of generative design and multi-criteria performance analysis for urban design decision making. The relationships between geometric urban forms and multiple performance criteria are identified. The proposed methodology incorporates the reinforcement learning algorithm, an advanced machine learning technique, along with parametric modeling techniques, to enhance urban design decisions based on various performance criteria. This methodology was tested on the design of an international campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology, located in Shenzhen, China. An algorithm generates numerous geometrical alternatives of campus design under site constraints and development requirements of the campus. Those alternatives are then evaluated based on performance criteria of sky openings, solar radiation, or energy consumption synthetically. The method enables an integrated performance analysis for all possible design under constraints. The paper proposes a data driven urban design approach that connect generative design and multi-criteria performance analyses. The relationships between urban geometric forms and performance criteria function derive guidelines for a sustainable and green campus. In future conduct multivariate analysis to examine the relationships between geometric elements and performance measurement metrics.},

There have been few robust evaluations of active travel, and very few studies have valued health and emissions outcomes. The ACTIVE before-and-after quasi-experimental study estimated the net benefits of health and other outcomes from New Zealand\&rsquo;s Model Communities Programme using an empirical analysis comparing two intervention cities with two control cities. The Programme funded investment in cycle paths, other walking and cycling facilities, cycle parking, \&lsquo;shared spaces\&rsquo;, media campaigns and events, such as \&lsquo;Share the Road\&rsquo;, and cycle-skills training. Using the modified Integrated Transport and Health Impacts Model, the Programme\&rsquo;s net economic benefits were estimated from the changes in use of active travel modes. Annual benefits for health in the intervention cities were estimated at 34.4 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and two lives saved due to reductions in cardiac disease, diabetes, cancer, and respiratory disease. Reductions in transport-related carbon emissions were also estimated and valued. Using a discount rate of 3.5\%, the estimated benefit/cost ratio was 11:1 and was robust to sensitivity testing. It is concluded that when concerted investment is made in active travel in a city, there is likely to be a measurable, positive return on investment.},

The long-run trend rate in these markets ranged between approximately 1.6 and 3.2 per cent per annum. Hong Kong, Singapore and Taipei have relatively higher figures, which could be expected in light of the rapidly growing economies. Surprisingly, their cyclical patterns were fairly similar, although causes of the cycles differed. The markets were found to have stochastic cycles of around one year, two to four years and seven to ten years, which were consistent with previous findings on real business cycles commonly observed internationally in other macroeconomic time series. However, the found stochastic nature suggests all these markets are not in a steady state and is still changing.},

However, there is evidence that the attractiveness of superstar cities has declined over time. In addition, we find that the next-tier cities (i.e., alternative cities) become increasingly attractive to elites.

The first step is to identify the supporting vectors (SVs) to price variances using the stepwise multi-regression approach; and then it is to forecast the housing price variances by employing the SVs identified by the first step as well as other variables postulated by the hedonic price theory, where the housing prices in Taipei City are empirically examined to verify the designed framework. Results computed by nonparametric estimation confirm that the prediction power of using SVM in housing price forecasting is of high accuracy. Further studies are suggested to extract the geographical weights using kernel density estimates to reflect price responses to local quantiles of hedonic attributes.},

Research in the field of machine learning has been exploring the use of random forest as a framework within which many traffic and transport problems can be investigated. The random forest (RF) is a powerful method for constructing an ensemble of random decision trees. It de-correlates the decision trees in the ensemble via randomization that leads to an improvement of forecasting and reduces the variance when averaged over the trees. However, the usefulness of RF for travel mode choice behavior remains largely unexplored. This paper proposes a robust random forest method to analyze travel mode choices for examining the prediction capability and model interpretability. Using the travel diary data from Nanjing, China in 2013, enriched with variables on the built environment, the effects of different model parameters on the prediction performance are investigated. The comparison results show that the random forest method performs significantly better in travel mode choice prediction for higher accuracy and less computation cost. In addition, the proposed method estimates the relative importance of explanatory variables and how they relate to mode choices. This is fundamental for a better understanding and effective modeling of people's travel behavior.},

In the absence of a policy framework it has been unclear what the impact of these policies have been or how they should be evaluated. This study presents an analytical framework through which the issue can be better understood before policy options are explored and analyzed. The framework consists of, firstly, an analysis of the role of secondary suites in the Vancouver housing scene; secondly, an assessment of the secondary suite "problem" in Vancouver and how it has been dealt with; thirdly, an analysis of incidence of effects of the secondary suite arrangement; and, finally, a policy analysis model based on the preceding findings. The sources of information include published reports and statistics, classified advertisements that are tabulated, interviews with informants who have been involved in dealing with the secondary suite issue as well as informal interviews with about 50 people directly involved in a secondary suite arrangement. Based on the understanding of the secondary suite issue, two basic policy orientations are identified. The first one is to reduce the number of secondary suites in the City while the second one is to change the suites into an acceptable form of housing. The alternative means to implement these policies are identified and the correlation between these means, the functions they can serve and the effect they have on the City's housing situation and the secondary suite issue are outlined. It is hoped that the findings will be useful to planners in formulating more effective policies and to decision-makers in deciding on the most appropriate solution for the City's secondary suite issue.},

In this study, we proposed the use of online rental listings as a new reliable data source for mapping housing rent. With the collected individual rental information from an online platform, we attempted to produce the fine-scale spatial pattern of housing rent in the metropolitan area of Guangzhou, China, at the neighborhood committee (NC) level. This involves the task of estimating the housing rent for areas with no observation data of housing rent. To this end, we evaluated six numeric prediction methods of machine learning. We further enhanced their performance through ensemble learning, an approach which can form new classifiers with even better performance than any of the individual constituent classifiers. We implemented ensemble learning through ways of bagging and stacking, and selected the most accurate ensemble classifier to produce the spatial pattern of housing rent at the NC-level. In the resulting housing rent pattern, we identified a distance decay relationship between the housing rent and the distance from the city center. The data sources and the ensemble learning platform in this application of housing rent mapping are generally open access. Therefore, the proposed approach in this study can provide useful hints for housing rent mapping in other geographical areas. Our mapping results can also be integrated with additional information to support the studies of urban residential problems in China.},

Zoning is of important practical significance, for example, knowing regional differences and characteristics, regional research and regional development planning, understanding the favorable and unfavorable conditions of the regional development etc. Geographical environment is arising from the geographical position linkages. Geographical environment unit division is also a type of zoning. The geographical environment indicators are deeply studied and summed up in the article, including the background, the associated and the potential. The background indicators are divided into four categories, such as the socio-economic, the political and military, the strategic resources and the ecological environment, which can be divided into more sub-indexes. While the sub-indexes can be integrated to comprehensive index system by weighted stacking method. The Jenks natural breaks classification method, also called the Jenks optimization method, is a data classification method designed to determine the best arrangement of values into different classes. This is done by seeking to minimize each class's average deviation from the class mean, while maximizing each class's deviation from the means of the other groups. In this paper, the experiment of Chinese surrounding geographical environment unit division has been done based on the natural breaks (jenks) method, the geographical environment index system and the weighted stacking method, taking South Asia as an example. The result indicates that natural breaks (jenks) method is of good adaptability and high accuracy on the geographical environment unit division.},

Both entropy and fractal dimensions can be employed to characterize complex spatial systems such as cities and regions. Despite the inherent connection between entropy and fractal dimensions, they have different application scopes and directions in urban studies. This paper focuses on exploring how to convert entropy measurements into fractal dimensions for the spatial analysis of scale-free urban phenomena using the ideas from scaling. Urban systems proved to be random prefractal and multifractal systems. The spatial entropy of fractal cities bears two properties. One is the scale dependence: the entropy values of urban systems always depend on the linear scales of spatial measurement. The other is entropy conservation: different fractal parts bear the same entropy value. Thus, entropy cannot reflect the simple rules of urban processes and the spatial heterogeneity of urban patterns. If we convert the generalized entropies into multifractal spectrums, the problems of scale dependence and entropy homogeneity can be solved to a degree for urban spatial analysis. Especially, the geographical analyses of urban evolution can be simplified. This study may be helpful for students in describing and explaining the spatial complexity of urban evolution.},

As the demand for taxis changes with space and time, it is important to model both the space and temporal dimensions in dynamic booking data. Several applications can benefit from a good taxi booking model. These include the prediction of number of bookings at certain location and time of the day, and the detection of anomalous booking events. In this paper, we propose a Grid-based Gaussian Mixture Model (GGMM) with spatio-temporal dimensions that groups booking data into a number of spatio-temporal clusters by observing the bookings occurring at different time of the day in each spatial grid cell. Using a large-scale real-world dataset consisting of over millions of booking records, we show that GGMM outperforms two strong baselines: a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and the state-of-the-art spatio-temporal behavior model, Periodic Mobility Model (PMM), in estimating the spatio-temporal distribution of bookings at specific grid cells during specific time intervals. GGMM can achieve up to 95.8\% (96.5\%) reduction in perplexity compared against GMM (PMM). Further, we apply GGMM to detect anomalous bookings and successfully relate the anomalies with some known events, demonstrating GGMM's effectiveness in this task.},

In recent years spatial economics has focused on the spatial location of economic activities and its determinants. At the city-region level a significant part of the analysis has been concerned with the concept of agglomeration as a source of economies of scale, productivity growth, and the role of transport: the spatial accessibility economies. Empirical evidence of the relationship between multi-scales spatial accessibilities and movement economies, as dependant on spatial configuration, is well charted in the space syntax literature. Using space syntax spatial analyses, the socio-economic and spatial patterns of 10 centres located in Inner and Outer London are analysed. The findings show that centres have specific spatial configuration signatures which distinguish centres from their spatial context. These signatures lead to the identification of centre spatial factor components. The interaction between socio-economic compositional effect and spatial signature profiles is investigated and leads to preliminary centre socio-economic/spatial typologies.},

To curb the insidious spread of graft and bribery, anti-corruption measures should be built into any planning system as part of its structure. Corruption in the planning field is largely tied to the opportunities that land-use planning generates by allocating development rights and land uses (following a discretionary and differentiated logic). This paper will explore some of the principles and techniques (transparent negotiation, auction of development rights, recovery of land rent, and formal equality in a radical version) that can be implemented to contain or eliminate corruption at the outset.},

This wide range of urban actors has produced a variety of goods and services through the broadening and strengthening of their social networks, resulting in the construction of unique places. Thus it is at the intersection of these diverse activities, multiple networks, and unique places that the inner-city neighborhoods produce major urban vitality. This study focuses on the work of two dance troupes in San Francisco, Flyaway Productions and De Rompe y Raja, as producer of urban vitality and as a window of observation for a broader development process.},

This study combines two on-going research projects dealing with issues in urban form, one on urban diversity and the other on walkability, both trying to develop the conceptualization and the measurement of these qualities. Regarding diversity, scales and categorizations as two essential factors for evaluating diversity are examined in this study by the implementation of analysis at various configurational levels and on access to variety. From the research project on walkability, a qualitative observation study was conducted examining the subjective measurement of pedestrian density and its patterns, the route choices made in the walking trips observed while tracking pedestrians, and the different types of walking activities taking place in the study areas. By obtaining hard data on real behaviors of walking in different situations, it provides a detailed description of the walking activities and their patterns in three neighborhoods in Stockholm, Sweden, where the quantitative analysis regarding diversity was also conducted.},

  abstract = {The issue of pedestrian-friendly urban environments has been of increasing importance lately in urban planning and design. In order to develop a better knowledge about the walkability of the built environment, it is important to understand the complexity behind walking behavior. Since different kinds of walking activities vary in their goal, effort, frequency, duration, etc., they also vary in how strongly and in what aspect they are influenced by the condition of urban form. With an empirical study in three residential areas in Stockholm, Sweden, this study investigated the different types of walking activities in how they interact with the built environment. The results showed that the condition of the built environment related to the density, connectivity, and land-use diversity seems to influence the amount and diversity of walking activities and also affect how the walking activities are conducted. This is related to the degree of the potential urban form has in providing the different qualities that the pedestrians desire from the environment, which is not only related to providing walking destinations and possible routes, but also qualities that enhance the experiential quality of walking. Investigating the different aspects of walking in how they occur and are conducted in the urban environment is important in understanding why and how different conditions of the urban form discourage or encourage walking. This is not only useful in providing insights for more accurate knowledge on walkability, but also assists a better understanding and application of other urban design theories on pedestrian movement as well.},

We adopt our previously developed parametric tools for design communication as a bridging method between conventional and participatory urban design approaches. We hypothesise that a virtual participatory urban design platform can provide more design associated information for laypeople to participate in design decision-making. The conventional urban design approaches investigate urban form as purely through the lens of urban professionals. In participatory urban design approaches the design decisions remain as general assumptions because of lack of enough associated information. Therefore, we have developed a methodology to produce urban forms by taking advantages of computational tools to engage stakeholders in complex urban design decision-making processes. This paper focuses on designing the charrette tools. We propose a mixed method of virtual and actual to orient people in the design discussion. We investigate our tools for Karori, a neighbourhood in New Zealand. We critically conclude the paper with an overview of our virtual design communication tools which is destined to engage people in a later stage.},

Specifically, Brotchie's urban triangle is modified to represent the commuting benchmarks (minimum and maximum commutes) and urban form of a city. By comparing the urban triangle of a city at different points in time, it is possible to determine whether commuting behaviour is becoming more or less efficient with respect to urban form. Also, comparisons can be made across multiple cities for a specific point in time. The method is applied empirically to examine the commuting efficiencies of three Canadian cities (Hamilton, Halifax and Vancouver) for three census years (1996, 2001 and 2006). Comparative analyses reveal the drawbacks of the excess commuting and commuting potential utilised approaches and demonstrate that the proposed method overcomes these limitations.},

A new student housing complex on the campus of the University of Patras, Greece, was used as a test-bed for experimentation with the developed design algorithms that link local climatic data with the site topography and the basic geometric features of the buildings on the site. The parametric process and the design algorithms were particularly useful in the early design stage, during which various arrangements of the buildings on the site were studied, in order to optimize their environmental performance.},

In addition to spatial autocorrelations of land use, Auto-ANNs-CLUE-s considers the nonlinear relationships between driving factors and land-use patterns. Results of a three-map comparison indicate that the Auto-ANNs-CLUE-s model has a better overall performance than Autologistic-CLUE-s. The Auto-ANNs-CLUE-s is highly applicable for all resolutions from multiresolution validation. The results of landscape metrics demonstrate the prevalence of urban sprawl in the study area.

A comprehensive introductory chapter is followed by four parts offering complete coverage of the area:   Markets: examines the perception of housing markets, how they function in different contexts, and the importance of housing behaviour and neighbourhoods  Approaches: looks at how other disciplines - economics, geography, and sociology - have informed the direction of housing studies  Context: traces the interactions between housing studies and other aspects of society, providing context to debate housing through issues of space, social, welfare and the environment.  Policy: is a multi-disciplinary and comprehensive take on the major policy issues and the causes and possible solutions of housing problems such as regeneration and homelessness.   Edited by leading names in the field and including international contributions, the book is a stimulating, wide-ranging read that will be an invaluable resource for academics and researchers in geography, urban studies, sociology, social policy, economics and politics.},

The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between methods used to measure house price indices and economic determinants of house prices at the local level. Non-nested tests proposed by Davidson and MacKinnon (Econometrica, 49(3), 781-793, 1981) and by Green (Economic Letters, 31, 349-354, 1989) are extended to deal with contemporaneous correlation among disturbance terms. Also, a new {$\chi$}2 test is developed to evaluate differences in the functional relationships between alternative house price indices and economic variables. Twomethods for measuring house price changes are used: the repeat sales method and the assessed value (AV) method. Data for Hartford, Connecticut, indicate that the correlation between the annual rates of change in these two price indices is high (about 0.8). But the percentage changes in the two price indices differ substantially over periods of 2 to 10 quarters. Nevertheless, the two price indices are related to economic variables, such as changes in local employment and unemployment, in a similar way. The results indicate a strong role for expected inflation and unemployment, both of which reduce house price changes. Furthermore, these variables have considerable forecasting ability, contrary to the efficient market hypothesis. Model results could be improved by combining AV and repeat price indices with about twice as much weight on the AV method.},

  abstract = {Development of new vaccine technology has been plagued with problems in the past. The current RNA based SARSCoV-2 vaccines were approved in the US using an emergency order without extensive long term safety testing. In this paper the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine was evaluated for the potential to induce prion-based disease in vaccine recipients. The RNA sequence of the vaccine as well as the spike protein target interaction were analyzed for the potential to convert intracellular RNA binding proteins TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43) and Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) into their pathologic prion conformations. The results indicate that the vaccine RNA has specific sequences that may induce TDP-43 and FUS to fold into their pathologic prion confirmations. In the current analysis a total of sixteen UG tandem repeats ({$\Psi$}G{$\Psi$}G) were identified and additional UG ({$\Psi$}G) rich sequences were identified. Two GG{$\Psi$}A sequences were found. Potential G Quadruplex sequences are possibly present but a more sophisticated computer program is needed to verify these. Furthermore, the spike protein, created by the translation of the vaccine RNA, binds angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a zinc containing enzyme. This interaction has the potential to increase intracellular zinc. Zinc ions have been shown to cause the transformation of TDP-43 to its pathologic prion configuration. The folding of TDP-43 and FUS into their pathologic prion confirmations is known to cause ALS, front temporal lobar degeneration, Alzheimer's disease and other neurological degenerative diseases. The enclosed finding as well as additional potential risks leads the author to believe that regulatory approval of the RNA based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 was premature and that the vaccine may cause much more harm than benefit.},

There are myriad clinical and case management implications. Failure to appreciate the potential frequency of false positives and the consequent unreliability of positive test results across a range of scenarios could unnecessarily remove critical workers from service, expose uninfected individuals to greater risk of infection, delay or impede appropriate medical treatment, lead to inappropriate treatment, degrade patient care, waste personal protective equipment, waste human resources in unnecessary contact tracing, hinder the development of clinical improvements, and weaken clinical trials. Measures to raise awareness of false positives, reduce their frequency, and mitigate their effects should be considered.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Despite several calls in this journal of debating the rapid growth of the literature on ``smart cities'', such a debate has in large been absent. Smart cities are often un-critically launched as a sustainable way of developing cities. When cities become increasingly complex as its features are wired into the Internet, theories for their understanding is lagging behind. As it is prospected that a greater number of people and things will become connected by Information and Computer Technology, the complexity of urban systems will over time increase. Historical insights reveal that as complexity in societies increase, growth in energy consumption tends to follow. In this paper, we discuss whether complexity carried too far could lead to diminishing returns of energy saving and create unmanageable urban systems. As part of initiating such a debate, this commentary asks whether the smart cities development has a bearing on the issue whether a society can erode its capacity of sustaining itself? We pose this question against the backdrop that no one actually knows what type of society the smart cities model in the end will generate.},

Using an urban ecology lens, we provide some reflections that need to forgo any wider-scale implementation of the Smart City-model with the goal to enhance urban sustainability. We discuss that the Smart City literature must better include analysis around social sustainability issues for city dwellers. Focus here should start on health issues and more critical analysis about whom the Smart City is for. Also, the literature must address issues of resilience and cyber security, including how Smart City solutions may affect the autonomy of urban governance, personal integrity and how it may affect the resilience of infrastructures that provide inhabitants with basic needs, such as food, energy and water security. A third major gap in this literature is how smart city developments may change human-nature relations. Focus here should start on how Smart City technologies may hinder or support children's learning towards a stronger psychological connection with nature. Discussions are also needed on how the Smart City model may affect pro-environmental behavior more broadly.},

To positively affect opportunities for active transport, public health and transport professionals are engaging with other sectors, including urban planning, housing, recreation, retail, education, and employer groups. A first step in such inter-sectoral collaboration is to understand the perceptions of key players in all of these sectors. This paper describes the results of structured interviews with senior and middle-level administrators from public, private, and community groups in a rapidly developing region in Queensland, Australia, to assess the perceived barriers and enablers to active transport. Key themes emerged relating to infrastructure delivery, public transport services, walk- and cycle-friendly community attributes, political leadership and government coordination, and societal travel norms and culture. There were also themes relating to limits due to resources and limited relevant technical expertise, institutional and practitioner cultures, and agencies not identifying with their roles in active transport. Policies and cross-government initiatives were seen to hold promise, including economic incentives and built environment guidelines, campaigns targeting public attitudes and opinions, and community participation in policy-making. These elements are potential keys to positively promoting comprehensive active transport initiatives among gatekeepers and leaders across different sectors.},

Yet there have been few direct attempts at a comparative assessment of the concept's performance in the different cultural settings in which it has been applied. This paper seeks to contribute to this goal, by examining the fringe-belt structure of several cities drawn from contrasting urban cultural traditions in Europe and the New World. Not surprisingly, certain commonalities emerge, but there are also large differences in the number, scale, complexity, and even basic geometry of fringe belts apparent in this eclectic examination. These differences go well beyond simple explanations of site circumstances, size, and function of the city within the urban hierarchy, and result from essential contrasts in urban social values, property rules, and planning traditions. The analysis leads to speculations about the efficacy and limits of the fringe-belt concept to identify and account for variations in the texture of urban form across urban areas in diverse cultural contexts.},

There is currently a need for link-level, city wide modelling of cycling, both to ensure the needs of existing cyclists are catered for in planning, and to model the effects of changing infrastructure in shaping cyclist behaviour. Existing SpNA models treat cyclists and car drivers as if they make navigational decisions in a similar way, which in reality is not the case. This paper presents an SpNA model using hybrid betweenness, which fits cyclist flows in Cardiff, Wales using distance, angular distance, motor vehicle traffic and slope as predictors of route choice. SpNA betweenness is also shown to implicitly capture the effect of urban density on mode choice. As it handles route finding decisions of drivers and cyclists separately, the model presented is also applicable to road safety models examining the interaction between the two classes of road user. The model has low cost of data collection and is reproducible using publicly available network analysis software and open mapping data. Further avenues for modelling the effect of infrastructure on cycling are discussed.},

  abstract = {To determine the development feasibility of a parcel of land, a potential purchaser is required to synthesize multiple information sets including local planning data, land records, financial metrics and most importantly the design rules and criteria for compliance. The information sources for the data required for a feasibility are often found on separate databases and systems and are usually not in standardised digital formats. This paper outlines the framework for a Development Feasibility Framework, highlighting the extent of data required to determine feasibility, exploring the integration of geospatial databases and parametric modelling techniques to achieve the framework. The framework consists of three components; The Rules Engine, the Parametric Building Generator and the Feasibility Calculator. The first component, the Rules Engine, collates the planning rules and criteria required to determine if a design is feasible. Once the rules have been codified, the determination of the possible building designs are calculated using parametric modelling techniques through the Parametric Building Generator. Finally, once solutions have been generated, the final part of the platform is the feasibility calculation. The platform integrates with a Geographic Information System (GIS) database to allow for mass assessment of development feasibility and can also be used for urban planning.},

  abstract = {Architectural spatial design is a wicked problem that can have a multitude of solutions for any given brief. The information needed to resolve architectural design problems is often not readily available during the early conceptual stages, requiring proposals to be evaluated only after an initial solution is reached. This ``solution-driven'' design approach focuses on the generation of designs as a means to explore the solution space. Generative design can be achieved computationally through parametric and algorithmic processes. However, utilizing a large repertoire of organiational patterns and design precedent knowledge together with the precise criteria of spatial evaluation can present design challenges even to an experienced architect. In the implementation of a parametric design process lies an opportunity to supplement the designer's knowledge with computational decision support that provides real-time spatial feedback during conceptual design. This paper presents an approach based on a generative multiperformance framework, configured for generating and optimizing architectural designs based on a precedent design. The system is constructed using a parametric modeling environment enabling the capture of precedent designs, extraction of spatial analytics, and demonstration of how populations can be used to drive the generation and optimization of alternate spatial solutions. A pilot study implementing the complete workflow of the system is used to illustrate the benefits of coupling parametric modeling with structured precedent analysis and design generation.},

Proper planning is essential and requires data. Manually fabricating data that represent streets (street reconstruction) is error-prone and time consuming. Automatising street reconstruction is a challenge because of the diversity, size, and scale of the details (few centimetres for cornerstone) required. The state-of-the-art focuses on roads (no context, no urban features) and is strongly determined by each application (simulation, visualisation, planning). We propose a unified framework that works on real Geographic Information System (GIS) data and uses a strong, yet simple modelling hypothesis when possible to robustly model streets at the city level or street level. Our method produces a coherent street-network model containing topological traffic information, road surface and street objects. We demonstrate the robustness and genericity of our method by reconstructing the entire city of Paris streets and exploring other similar reconstruction (airport driveway).},

  abstract = {From the time cities first evolved, they have been subject to human intervention at every level of activity \textendash{} in other words they have been designed. The following paper argues that since this process was formalized at the beginning of the 20th century as urban design, its rationale as a discipline has been fraught with consequence. It has been continuously defined as other \textendash{} half way between the two professions of architecture and urban planning. This unjustified otherness has been reflected in approaches to urban design theory. Even the middle ground which urban design is supposed to occupy is an amalgam of architectural and planning ideologies and practices. The following paper takes a hard look at the last 50 years, exposing the most serious attempts to synthesize or theorize significant urban design paradigms. While each attempt has much to commend it, variously exhibiting great insight, dedication, knowledge and scholarship, I feel that the collective result has been a generalized anarchy of creative ideas that bear little coherence, either internally or collectively. Whether this is `good' or `bad' is beside the point, it is where evolution has brought us. Nor does this situation signify any immunity on my part to the uses of disorder, chance and chaos, in the spirit that `there is no idea, however ancient and absurd, that is not capable of improving our knowledge' (Feyerabend, 1975, p. 33). The hypothesis explored below proposes that the failure has an obvious cause \textendash{} there has been no concerted attempt within the discipline to link the material creation or `designing' of urban space and form to fundamental societal processes. More importantly, this linkage is desirable, and can be made. The fracture has many causes \textendash{} historical, professional, ideological, academic, egocentric, as well as misplaced idealism. Rather than pursuing the quest for an integrated theory which has little possibility of success, I argue that a better outcome already exists in spatial political economy, itself a somewhat anarchistic pursuit, but one of better quality. The framework of ideas which it encompasses offers urban design both legitimation and theoretical coherence. In so doing, urban design can exit the nefarious middle ground allocated to it by architecture and planning. Instead, it can connect directly to the economic, political, social and cultural processes which structure social life.

  abstract = {Minimum parking requirements (MPRs) are the norm for urban and suburban development in the United States (Davidson et al., 2002). The justification for MPRs is that overflow parking will occupy nearby street or off-street parking. Shoup (1999a) and Willson (1995) provide cases where there is reason to believe that parking space requirements have forced parcel developers to place more parking than they would in the absence of parking requirements. However, to our knowledge the existing literature does not test the effect of parking minimums on the amount of lot space devoted to parking beyond a few case studies. This paper tests the hypothesis that MPRs bind for most land uses using data on suburban office, commercial, industrial and retail property sales from Los Angeles County using both direct and indirect approaches. Our indirect test of the effects of parking requirements is similar to the one used by Glaeser and Gyourko (2003). A simple theoretical model shows that the marginal value of additional parking to the sale price of a building should be equal to the cost of land plus the cost of parking construction. We estimate the marginal values of parking and lot area with spatial methods using a large data set from the Los Angeles area non-residential property sales and find that for most of the property types the marginal value of parking is significantly below that of the parcel area. In addition, we directly examine required and supplied parking and find that on average parking supplied is quite close to the required amount.},

When new buildings are constructed to high performance standards, increased rates of building replacement spurred by rising property values can raise the operating efficiency of building stocks. However, it can take years before the embodied greenhouse gas emissions associated with new construction are offset by more efficient operations. This paper calculates the carbon dioxide emission payback period of newly constructed efficient single family homes in Vancouver, British Columbia. The average carbon dioxide emission payback period of 168 years for a typical high efficiency new home renders it unlikely that emission savings will be realized before it is replaced. A statistical model called the Teardown Index is presented, which indicates that replacing older poorly performing homes with new high efficiency homes in Vancouver will result in 1.3\textendash 2.8 million tonnes of additional carbon dioxide equivalent emissions between 2017 and 2050. For each percent increase to the compound annual growth rate of property values, an additional 150 thousand tonnes of CO2e will be released between 2017-2050. The findings suggest that current policies aimed at reducing emissions through new high efficiency buildings should be reconsidered.},

We present a generative network model (GNM) considering geographical and topological effects, thus combining factors commonly analysed through traditional spatial simulation models (e.g., gravity models) and topological simulation models (e.g., actor-oriented stochastic models) in a single framework. In our GNM, it is assumed that the probability of connections between cities emerges from competing forces. Stimulating factors are a measure of city size (i.e., population) and a topological rule favoring the formation of connections between cities sharing nearest neighbours (i.e., transitive effects). The hampering factors are physical distance between two cities as well as institutional distance (i.e., border effects). We discuss the model in the context of on-going engagements between urban-geographical research and the network science literature, and validate the credence of the model against empirical data on the transport networks connecting 51 major cities in Southeast Asia. Our results show that (1) the generated networks approximate the observed ones in terms of average path length, clustering, modularity, efficiency and quadratic assignment procedure (QAP) correlation between the observed composite network and the generated one, and that (2) GNM performs best when topographical and topological factors are considered simultaneously. Each factor contributes differently to network formation, with transitive effects playing the most important role.},

A case study of a brownfield development in Victoria, Canada, confirms concerns in the literature about income diversity in brownfield developments; a second case study of a Toronto neighbourhood suggests that there is no guarantee that local sustainable development projects within existing neighbourhoods will encourage or even maintain existing social diversity and equity. A similar trend is demonstrated in a series of infill projects that had profound ramifications on adjacent communities and indeed contributed to greater unsustainability in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver, British Columbia.

  year = {2016},
  month = dec,
  abstract = {Canadian media is showing increased coverage of residents struggling to afford housing and residents being displaced from their communities due to the rising cost of housing and neighbourhood redevelopment. Simultaneously, Canadian city-regions are encouraging high density housing in urban cores with mixed-uses as part of an increasing desire for smart growth. However, many researchers in urban planning are finding redevelopment in the forms of revitalization and densification may contribute to a loss of affordable housing. 
 
 My research explores to what extent planners from five Canadian city-regions (Vancouver, Edmonton, Greater Toronto Area, Halifax, and St. John's) address objectives for redevelopment and affordable housing in tandem (in discussion and planning documents), if planners recognize the negative impacts of redevelopment on affordable housing, and if the language for redevelopment and affordable housing objectives is equally compulsory and specific. 
 
 My analysis of interviews with 92 practicing planners and 24 planning documents indicates that planners address redevelopment objectives significantly more often than affordable housing objectives and the objectives are seldom addressed in tandem. The few times planners address both objectives together, planners often state that redevelopment (usually in the form of densification, but sometimes as revitalization) leads to increased and improved affordable housing. Planners rarely address the negative impacts redevelopment can have on affordable housing. The language for objectives to increase density is sometimes more compulsory than language used to increase or protect affordable housing. Many planners address frustration with provincial and federal governments not taking responsibility for affordable housing. 
 
 Research on revitalization and densification overwhelmingly shows these forms of redevelopment may lead to a loss of affordable housing (as prices increase and family-style housing is lost). However, Canadian planners have formed an unevaluated consensus that density and revitalization will improve and increase affordable housing. They are further encouraging site re-use, revitalization, and intensification.},

We estimate a model of house prices that include changes in minimum lot size at the zoning district level, variables that account for possible spillover effects in the same town and in nearby towns, and zoning district fixed effects. We estimate price effects due to MLR of 20\% or more at the upper end of the impact distribution. We find evidence of significant spillover effects within towns that are similar to those in the zoning district in which the MLR changed. The impact on house prices in nearby towns is significant and as high as 5\%. Finally, we find that the impact increases over time with effects as large as 40\% occurring 10years after the change in MLR.},

In this paper the author introduces new work extending the concept of intelligibility and synergy introduced by Hillier (1996). The paper shows how a local correlation method can be use to produce point intelligibility and point synergy. The paper goes on to show why it is convenient to replace the radius mechanism with the vicinity mechanism to achieve consistent results. The paper highlights that these axial point intelligibility and point synergy values appear to be nearly uniform across a named neighbourhood and that they can therefore be used as a means of identification purely from the axial models commonly used in space syntax. The paper produces empirical data from Hampstead Garden Suburb and Brentham Garden Suburb demonstrating that the use of point synergy and point intelligibly neighbourhood are consistent with the average bounds produced by surveying neighbourhood inhabitants. This paper concludes that, although further investigation is called for, this method is evidence that spatial design appears to have causative effect on the formation of neighbourhoods.},

In this paper, social infrastructure is defined as life-long social service needs related to health, education, early childhood, community support, community development, culture, sport and recreation, parks and emergency services. These services are needed to promote health and wellbeing and underinvestment and poor planning of social infrastructure has been linked to area-based health inequities. Current methods used to plan infrastructure delivery in communities were analysed and a new conceptual framework of social infrastructure developed and empirically tested using geocoded health survey data linked to spatial social infrastructure measures.

Using a case study of Melbourne, the demand for car parking at residential apartment buildings in proximity to high frequency public transport is assessed, while controlling for a range of socio-demographic, urban design and demand management variables. Key findings indicate that while lower demand for car parking is associated with proximity to high quality public transport, this association is not significant when controlling for other factors that influence car ownership. Public transport service supply within 800~m of residential apartment buildings was instead found to be significant, rather than simple distance to transit. Modelling results suggest an inelastic relationship whereby a 10\% increase in public transport service supply is associated with a 0.9\textendash 1.2\% reduction in car parking demand as measured by levels of car ownership. Notwithstanding broader criticisms of residential off-street parking minimums, the findings have important implications for the development of residential car parking policies, suggesting that city-wide car parking requirements should appropriately reflect the spatial distribution and quality of public transport services.},

  abstract = {The Death and Life of Great American Cities was written in 1961 and is now one of the most influential book in city planning. In it, Jane Jacobs proposed four conditions that promote life in a city. However, these conditions have not been empirically tested until recently. This is mainly because it is hard to collect data about "city life". The city of Seoul recently collected pedestrian activity through surveys at an unprecedented scale, with an effort spanning more than a decade, allowing researchers to conduct the first study successfully testing Jacobs's conditions. In this paper, we identify a valuable alternative to the lengthy and costly collection of activity survey data: mobile phone data. We extract human activity from such data, collect land use and socio-demographic information from the Italian Census and Open Street Map, and test the four conditions in six Italian cities. Although these cities are very different from the places for which Jacobs's conditions were spelled out (i.e., great American cities) and from the places in which they were recently tested (i.e., the Asian city of Seoul), we find those conditions to be indeed associated with urban life in Italy as well. Our methodology promises to have a great impact on urban studies, not least because, if replicated, it will make it possible to test Jacobs's theories at scale.},

Its underlying principle assumes that the more important a feature is, the more the weights, connected to the respective input neuron, will change during the training of the model. To capture this behavior, a running variance of every weight connected to the input layer is measured during training. For that, an adaptation of Welford's online algorithm for computing the online variance is proposed. When the training is finished, for each input, the variances of the weights are combined with the final weights to obtain the measure of relative importance for each feature. This method was tested with shallow and deep neural network architectures on several well-known classification and regression problems. The results obtained confirm that this approach is making meaningful measurements. Moreover, results showed that the importance scores are highly correlated with the variable importance method from Random Forests (RF).},

Although most commentators are still drawn to her writings on urban physical form and social interactions, a few have discussed her economic and ethical insights. Interest in the inductive methodology she used to generate her ideas and the ``organized complexity'' paradigm that shaped her worldview, however, has been sparse because of their apparent lack of sophistication. This paper, the first of two connected works in which we explore both the development and the full fruition of Jacobs as spontaneous economic order theorist and methodologist, posits that specific influences and experiences in Jacobs' formative years and throughout her diversified intellectual apprenticeship led her to develop her unorthodox, yet predictive, research approach. Our follow-on paper discusses Jacobs' use of metaphor and inductive methods as research tools firmly in, and of, the current philosophical understanding of the scientific method.},

The development of compact urban forms and the design of urban communities which favour walking are seen as particular effective strategies for reducing car dependency. The factors which determine travel behaviou are not fully understood, so that effective policies influencing travel patterns are difficult to formulate. Apart from urban form and design, personal attributes and circumstances have an impact on modal choice and distances travelled. People with higher incomes are more likely to own and use a private car than low-income households. Families with children use cars mo often than one-person households. The purpose of a trip - work, shopping and leisure - a influences travel mode and distance. We used the Netherlands National Travel Survey (OVG) to explore some of these relationships in more depth. The relative importance of personal attribute and the characteristics of residential environments as determinants of modal choice and travel distance were explored. Both sets of factors maintain a clear, strong relationship with travel behaviour in multivariate models of travel behaviour.},

Street networks that are more grid-like are preferred over networks that include many cul-de-sacs and long blocks, thus increasing distances between destinations. The increased distances are thought to discourage walking and bicycling and, thus, physical activity. While intuitively attractive, there is limited empirical research at this time making this connection. There is also debate over how to measure connectivity and what levels of connectivity are appropriate. The objective of this research is to evaluate various measures of connectivity for the purpose of increasing walking and bicycling. Measures of connectivity can be useful in two arenas: (1) research linking travel behavior (and perhaps physical activity and health) to urban form; and (2) public policy establishing performance standards for new and/or existing development. This paper first defines and describes a wide range of measures of connectivity, drawn from multiple fields, including transportation, urban planning, geography, and landscape ecology. The paper then includes some preliminary results applying four measures of connectivity to the Portland, Oregon region.},

  abstract = {With nearly four decades of academic focus on the issue of gentrification behind us, little progress seems to have been achieved in controlling the negative externalities of the process. While admittedly a complex configuration of costs and benefits, the continued march of gentrification throughout post-industrial cities has left the painful consequences of displacement not only unchecked, but often embraced and encouraged by governments and the private sector as the engine of urban renewal and regeneration, and a solution to decaying centres in search of livability. By prioritizing the beneficial aspects of gentrification, often only to the benefit of those able to afford the costly new landscapes, inner-city transformation has intensified the problematic realities of social conflict and housing affordability within our cities. With this seemingly unstoppable momentum of gentrification and its transformation of neighbourhoods into exclusive enclaves for the white-collar work force well underway, the question this thesis attempts to answer is: can gentrification be stopped? Historical examples have shown us that with sufficient public consensus around issues of non-market housing provision, gains in affordability can be achieved. However, in today's political context it seems ideologically unlikely that the level of public support required for such successes will be repeated. Instead, this research explores the potential for possible policy intervention by identifying and seeking to understand where the advance of gentrification in Vancouver has been surprisingly delayed, or diverted, and why? With Grandview-Woodland in East Vancouver as a case study the thesis uncovers the bases for alternative policy options for communities confronting neighbourhood change as a result of gentrification.},

  abstract = {Global oil prices have risen markedly over the past 18 months, generating considerable speculation regarding their economic and social impacts. Cities that are highly dependent on petroleum for urban transport are likely to be most adversely affected by rising oil prices. Yet there has been little recent scholarly engagement with the socioeconomic implications of increasing oil prices. This paper develops a basic framework and methodology for assessing the socioeconomic 'oil vulnerability' of Australian cities. The paper demonstrates that there is wide spatial variability in the vulnerability of Australia's urban populations to rising fuel costs which may compound existing socio-spatial divisions and speculates on some underlying causal factors. The paper calls for better data and new methods to understand the issue.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has been growing in recent years with the improvements in several different applications in the military, marine, intelligent transportation, smart health, smart grid, smart home and smart city domains. Although IoT brings significant advantages over traditional information and communication (ICT) technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), these applications are still very rare. Although there is a continuous improvement in road and vehicle safety, as well as improvements in IoT, the road traffic accidents have been increasing over the last decades. Therefore, it is necessary to find an effective way to reduce the frequency and severity of traffic accidents. Hence, this paper presents an intelligent traffic accident detection system in which vehicles exchange their microscopic vehicle variables with each other. The proposed system uses simulated data collected from vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) based on the speeds and coordinates of the vehicles and then, it sends traffic alerts to the drivers. Furthermore, it shows how machine learning methods can be exploited to detect accidents on freeways in ITS. It is shown that if position and velocity values of every vehicle are given, vehicles' behavior could be analyzed and accidents can be detected easily. Supervised machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forests (RF) are implemented on traffic data to develop a model to distinguish accident cases from normal cases. The performance of RF algorithm, in terms of its accuracy, was found superior to ANN and SVM algorithms. RF algorithm has showed better performance with 91.56\% accuracy than SVM with 88.71\% and ANN with 90.02\% accuracy.},

In reconceptualizing the problems faced by alternative urbanisms through the lens of science and technology studies, I explore how the intelligent trial-and-error (ITE) framework for governing emerging technologies could be extended to partially address the barriers of obduracy, uncertainty and complexity when pursuing alternative urban designs. An examination of how Baugruppen (cooperative building groups) were integrated into the planning process of Quartier Vauban, Freiburg, is used to illustrate both the potentials and a concrete application of an ITE-like approach. I then discuss some of the barriers to an ITE model of urban planning in North America and recommend further research at the intersection of urban studies and science and technology studies.},

Experience shows that this can lead to unforeseen conflicts (e.g., subsidence, groundwater pollution) and to lost opportunities (e.g., combined geothermal systems and building foundations or recycling of excavation materials). One challenge is how the underground potentials are assessed by urban actors; data collection, analysis and visualization for the different resources are often conducted in separate disciplinary corners and administrative divisions. This paper presents a mapping method developed within the Deep City project at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) and its application to San Antonio, Texas. San Antonio is interesting in its lack of major underground infrastructure and its few means and political support for short-term underground development. We will specifically look at the production of a series of interaction maps, an original mapping strategy that is complementary to the resource potential maps we have produced in prior work. After situating this research within larger theoretical and philosophical questions, we will show how mapping the combined potentiality of underground resources can serve as a compass for future interdisciplinary discussions that address the urban underground as a source of opportunity, rather than as an afterthought.},

To conceive urban plans with increased flexibility, a shape grammar-based design methodology is proposed which is capable of producing various design solutions instead of a single rigid layout. In this approach the plan is a design system encoding a set of alternative solutions, rather than a single, specific solution. This methodology was developed on the basis of the analysis of existing plans and on a series of experiments undertaken within the controlled environment of design studios. Results show that shape grammars produce urban plans with nondefinitive formal solutions, while keeping a consistent design language. They also provide plans with explicit and implicit flexibility, thereby giving future designers a wider degree of freedom. As a result, they are particularly appropriate for dealing with complexity and change throughout the legal lifespan of the plan. Finally, they provide students with a concrete methodology for approaching urban design, fostering the development of additional design skills.},

Specifically, the FTA New Starts Program is beginning to shift away from the current measure of user benefits, a calculation of changes in mobility measured by hours of travel time saved, towards criterion based on the concept of livability. As of this writing, the FTA has yet to define livability and establish metrics that will be adopted in the next rulemaking process.},

  abstract = {Some research shows that homes built under tougher building codes perform better in hurricanes. While houses built after the implementation of the stronger building codes could be presumed to be ``safer'', no study has measured the extent to which stricter building codes are capitalized into improved property. This study measures the capitalization of stricter building codes into house prices. In addition, the study examines whether homebuyers attach greater value to the stricter building codes after the ``reality check'' of the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons. A hedonic pricing model is used to capture the differential effect on house prices of the stricter 1994 South Florida Building Code for properties sold from 2000 through 2007 in Miami-Dade County. The model also measures any increase in the marginal value of the stronger building code after the 2004/2005 storm season. Models are estimated for the aggregate data and for three geographical zones based on risk exposure. Results show that the stricter building code has a positive effect on selling price. The greatest effect is seen in the coastal zone, which has the greatest risk exposure. Selling prices for homes built under the new code were about 10.4\% higher than prices for comparable homes built under the older, less strict code. The premium for safety is shown to decrease as the hurricane risk exposure decreases. For geographical areas with less risk exposure, there is less capitalization of the stricter building code into house prices. The post-catastrophe (``reality check'') variables show that, following the minimal impact of the 2004 hurricanes on the Miami area, the premium that consumers are willing to pay for structural integrity disappears. However, after the 2005 hurricanes, which were more devastating to the Miami area, the building code premium returns.},

The main findings, including optimisation and all the types of parameters, are presented by focussing on different aspects of buildings. In addition, usage of form-finding parameters of all reviewed studies and the distributions for each performance objectives are also presented. Moreover, usage of swarm and evolutionary optimisation algorithms in reviewed studies is summarised. Trends in publications, published years, problem scales, and building functions, are examined. Finally, future prospects are highlighted by focussing on different aspects of performative computational architecture in accordance to the evidence collected based on the review process.},

  abstract = {In the history, architecture was exploited to the human being to protect him from unsteady environmental conditions. In the past centuries, architecture was pioneer art which has special features such as; simplicity, organization, clear style, accurate decoration, material assembly, and so on. However, modern buildings become complex products that have so many parts which have to fulfil different functions. Therefore, new computational ways and techniques have been developed to facilitate the design of modern complicated buildings and to create a convenient quantitative relationship between the environment and the envelope, putting into consideration the obstacles which influence on the building design. This has therefore formed the concept of parametric design in architecture, in order to deal with complex designs and gain more accurate results. Modern architects claim that parametric design is the most creative way to understand the development and complexity of the new era of architectural trends [1]. Meanwhile, it is really hard to deal with sophisticated details in buildings using our brains to imagine, or conventional ways to design [2]. In addition, building technologies nowadays are integrated and containing many disciplines in the same time, and each discipline is dependent on the other disciplines in a very complex vast connections. Hence, they should be organized in a database container, and this container could be managed parametrically using parametric design as an advanced way to explore and understand these sophisticated relations [3]. This paper hence presents a literature review on parametric design in architecture practice and put a focus on its applications in daylighting and solar radiation, which can have an essential impact on improving daylight availability and energy saving.},

It argues that though Grand Paris Express has the potential to symbolically unify the \^Ile-de-France region, and may provide much needed infrastructure to the peripheral suburbs of Paris, because of the neoliberal political rationality upon which it is based, it may likely entrench rather than relieve the problems of territorial inequality it sets out to address. An important tool of gentrification, mass transit is being used in metropolitan Paris to lead urban development in the creation of a polycentric region with functionally differentiated clusters of industry, finance, and technology around proposed transit stations. Following four main `mobilizing myths' that dominate public policy debates, the proposed Grand Paris Express system fails to consider the broad social, economic, and political conditions upon which urban mobility is based, instead orienting transit toward a marketized logic of real estate development, urban rent production, and territorial competition.},

  abstract = {Throughout American history, cities have experienced rapid population growth during periods when they offered exceptionally well-paying jobs. But population growth in high-wage cities is only possible when people can find housing within a reasonable commuting distance. Unlike in the past, policymakers in some regions have implemented land use regulations that block new housing development, creating ``Closed Access'' cities. These are highly regulated cities that are not experiencing rapid population growth despite offering some of the highest wages and best career opportunities in the country.When housing demand increases in Closed Access cities, prices rise sharply. The burden of Closed Access rules falls disproportionately on low-income people, both because those people spend a greater percentage of their income on housing than high-income people do and because they are more often renters, paying more without enjoying an increase in home equity. The lackluster growth and high prices of Closed Access cities are caused by land use regulations that limit property owners' rights to build new housing.To restore the longstanding American traditions of national mobility and inclusive growth, policymakers from town halls to Capitol Hill must work to open up access to all of America's cities.},

  abstract = {Urban ecosystem services are crucial for human well-being and the livability of cities. A central challenge for sustaining ecosystem services lies in addressing scale mismatches between ecological processes on one hand, and social processes of governance on the other. This article synthesizes a set of case studies from urban green areas in Stockholm, Sweden\textemdash allotment gardens, urban parks, cemeteries and protected areas\textemdash and discusses how governmental agencies and civil society groups engaged in urban green area management can be linked through social networks so as to better match spatial scales of ecosystem processes. The article develops a framework that combines ecological scales with social network structure, with the latter being taken as the patterns of interaction between actor groups. Based on this framework, the article (1) assesses current ecosystem governance, and (2) develops a theoretical understanding of how social network structure influences ecosystem governance and how certain actors can work as agents to promote beneficial network structures. The main results show that the mesoscale of what is conceptualized as city scale green networks (i.e., functionally interconnected local green areas) is not addressed by any actor in Stockholm, and that the management practices of civil society groups engaged in local ecosystem management play a crucial but neglected role in upholding ecosystem services. The article proposes an alternative network structure and discusses the role of midscale managers (for improving ecological functioning) and scale-crossing brokers (engaged in practices to connect actors across ecological scales). Dilemmas, strategies, and practices for establishing this governance system are discussed.},

The chance of upward mobility for Americans is just half that of the citizens of the Denmark and many other European countries. In addition to other influences, the built environment may contribute to the low rate of upward mobility in the U.S. This study tests the relationship between urban sprawl and upward mobility for commuting zones in the U.S. We examine potential pathways through which sprawl may have an effect on mobility. We use structural equation modeling to account for both direct and indirect effects of sprawl on upward mobility. We find that upward mobility is significantly higher in compact areas than sprawling areas. The direct effect, which we attribute to better job accessibility in more compact commuting zones, is stronger than the indirect effects. Of the indirect effects, only one, through the mediating variable income segregation, is significant.},

Results: Operational definitions and measurement protocols were developed for five of nine urban design qualities: imageability, visual enclosure, human scale, transparency, and complexity. Conclusions: A field survey instrument has been developed, tested in the field, and further refined for use in active living research.},

  abstract = {Problem: Localities and states are turning to land planning and urban design for help in reducing automobile use and related social and environmental costs. The effects of such strategies on travel demand have not been generalized in recent years from the multitude of available studies. Purpose: We conducted a meta-analysis of the built environment-travel literature existing at the end of 2009 in order to draw generalizable conclusions for practice. We aimed to quantify effect sizes, update earlier work, include additional outcome measures, and address the methodological issue of self-selection. Methods: We computed elasticities for individual studies and pooled them to produce weighted averages. Results and conclusions: Travel variables are generally inelastic with respect to change in measures of the built environment. Of the environmental variables considered here, none has a weighted average travel elasticity of absolute magnitude greater than 0.39, and most are much less. Still, the combined effect of several such variables on travel could be quite large. Consistent with prior work, we find that vehicle miles traveled (VMT) is most strongly related to measures of accessibility to destinations and secondarily to street network design variables. Walking is most strongly related to measures of land use diversity, intersection density, and the number of destinations within walking distance. Bus and train use are equally related to proximity to transit and street network design variables, with land use diversity a secondary factor. Surprisingly, we find population and job densities to be only weakly associated with travel behavior once these other variables are controlled. Takeaway for practice: The elasticities we derived in this meta-analysis may be used to adjust outputs of travel or activity models that are otherwise insensitive to variation in the built environment, or be used in sketch planning applications ranging from climate action plans to health impact assessments. However, because sample sizes are small, and very few studies control for residential preferences and attitudes, we cannot say that planners should generalize broadly from our results. While these elasticities are as accurate as currently possible, they should be understood to contain unknown error and have unknown confidence intervals. They provide a base, and as more built-environment/travel studies appear in the planning literature, these elasticities should be updated and refined.

  abstract = {The sheer complexity and unpredictability characterising cities challenges the adequacy of existing disciplinary knowledge and tools in urban design and highlights the necessity to incorporate explicitly the element of change and the dimension of time in the understanding of, and intervention on, the form of cities. To this regard the concept of resilience is a powerful lens through which to understand and engage with a changing world. However, resilience is currently only superficially addressed by urban designers, and an explicit effort to relate elements of urban form to resilience principles is still lacking. This represents a great limit for urban designers, as the physical dimension of cities is the matter they work with in the first place. In this paper, we combine established knowledge in urban morphology and resilience theory. We firstly look at resilience theory and consistently define five proxies of resilience in urban form, namely diversity, redundancy, modularity, connectivity and efficiency. Secondly, we discuss the configuration of, and interdependencies between, several constituent elements of the physical city, as defined in urban morphology and design, in light of the mentioned five proxies. Finally, we conduct this exploration at five scales that are relevant to urban morphology and design: plot, street edge, block, street and sanctuary area / district.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Establishing new experimental animal models to assess the safety and immune response to the antigen used in the development of COVID-19 vaccine is an imperative issue. Based on the advantages of using zebrafish as a model in research, herein we suggest doing this to test the safety of the putative vaccine candidates and to study immune response against the virus. We produced a recombinant N-terminal fraction of the Spike SARS-CoV-2 protein and injected it into adult female zebrafish. The specimens generated humoral immunity and passed the antibodies to the eggs. However, they presented adverse reactions and inflammatory responses similar to severe cases of human COVID-19. The analysis of the structure and function of zebrafish and human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the main human receptor for virus infection, presented remarkable sequence similarities. Moreover, bioinformatic analysis predicted protein-protein interaction of the Spike SARS-CoV-2 fragment and the Toll-like receptor pathway. It might help in the choice of future therapeutic pharmaceutical drugs to be studied. Based on the \emph{in vivo} and \emph{in silico} results presented here, we propose the zebrafish as a model for translational research into the safety of the vaccine and the immune response of the vertebrate organism to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

By using simple justified graphs, it shows that topological steps on axial and continuity maps are equivalent to changes of direction on segment maps in a directional distance model. In other words, line maps are 'compressed versions' of segment maps. Line maps store part of the computations in the representation itself while segment maps rely mostly on the measures. A brief discussion about sizerelativisation is also provided. The paper ends with a discussion about potential developments for the ideas presented, which may lead to faster models that preserve data integrity and contribute to a renewed theoretical foundation for street network analysis.},

The RHEA (Risks and Hedonics in Empirical Agent-based land market) model captures natural hazard risks and environmental amenities through hedonic analysis, facilitating empirical agent-based land market modeling. RHEA is well grounded in economic theory and uses rich spatial data and econometric analysis. It moves beyond the existing work by explicitly simulating the emergence of property prices and their spatial distribution under adaptive price expectations of heterogeneous agents, advancing toward empirical modeling of agent-based land markets. At the same time RHEA operates in a realistic GIS landscape where realtor and households agents form ask and bid prices using empirical hedonic price functions. The simulation results demonstrate that this combination of theoretically sound micro-foundations in agents' behavior and empirical data is feasible. This opens opportunities to explore various methodological and policy-relevant research questions including exploration of abrupt non-marginal changes in markets and regime shifts in coupled socio-environmental systems.},

  abstract = {The recent slump notwithstanding, substantial increases in house prices in many parts of the United States have served to highlight housing affordability for moderate-income households, especially in high-cost, supply-constrained coastal cities such as Boston. In this article, we develop a new measure of area affordability that characterizes the supply of housing that is affordable to different households in different locations of a metropolitan region. Key to our approach is the explicit recognition that the price/rent of a dwelling is affected by its location. Hence, we develop an affordability methodology that accounts for job accessibility, school quality and safety. This allows us to produce a menu of town-level indexes of adjusted housing affordability. The adjustments are based on obtaining implicit prices of these amenities from a hedonic price equation. We thus use data from a wide variety of sources to rank 141 towns in the greater Boston metropolitan area based on their adjusted affordability. Taking households earning 80\% of area median income as an example, we find that consideration of town-level amenities leads to major changes relative to a typical assessment of affordability.},

The approach is equally applicable to an equilibrium-based planning model and to a telematics model of spontaneous and imperfectly informed drivers. It is based on consistent mathematical arguments, yet it is applicable in a purely simulation-based environment and, as our experimental results show, is capable of handling large scenarios.},

The urban fringes receive implicit land-rent subsidies from the governmental provision of public works and civic services paid for mostly by taxing properties, goods, and income, rather than only the land values generated by these public goods. The provision of utilities such as water is also skewed towards subsidizing the fringes. The taxation of most of the land rent or land value, combined with the elimination of other taxes, especially on improvements, would prevent such subsidies and allow development markets to generate an optimal urban development. Urban sprawl, defined as the use of land relative to optimal use, would gradually become eliminated with the elimination of both horizontal land subsidies and the taxation of vertical development. Land value taxation would also prevent distortive land speculation and, combined with a reduction of taxes on wages or goods paid from wages, would remove a major source of economic inequality while improving productivity.},

Some discussions focus on environmental features or means of making walkable environments, including areas being traversable, compact, physically enticing and safe. Others deal with outcomes potentially fostered by such environments, such as making places lively, enhancing sustainable transportation options and inducing exercise. Finally some use the term walkability as a proxy for better design whether composed of multiple, measurable dimensions or providing a holistic solution to urban problems. This review both problematizes the idea of walkability and proposes a conceptual framework distinguishing these definitions. This matters for urban design, because what is considered a walkable place varies substantially between definitions leading to substantially different designs. By mapping the range of definitions, this review highlights potential conflicts been forms of walkability.},

This study investigated how different types of street network buffering methods compared in measuring a set of commonly used built environment measures (BEMs) and tested their performance on associations with physical activity outcomes. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} An internationally-developed set of objective BEMs using three different spatial buffering techniques were used to evaluate the relative differences in resulting explanatory power on self-reported physical activity outcomes. BEMs were developed in five countries using `sausage,'`detailed-trimmed,' and `detailed,' network buffers at a distance of 1 km around participant household addresses (n = 5883). Results:\hspace{0.6em} BEM values were significantly different (p {$<$} 0.05) for 96\% of sausage versus detailed-trimmed buffer comparisons and 89\% of sausage versus detailed network buffer comparisons. Results showed that BEM coefficients in physical activity models did not differ significantly across buffering methods, and in most cases BEM associations with physical activity outcomes had the same level of statistical significance across buffer types. However, BEM coefficients differed in significance for 9\% of the sausage versus detailed models, which may warrant further investigation. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Results of this study inform the selection of spatial buffering methods to estimate physical activity outcomes using an internationally consistent set of BEMs. Using three different network-based buffering methods, the findings indicate significant variation among BEM values, however associations with physical activity outcomes were similar across each buffering technique. The study advances knowledge by presenting consistently assessed relationships between three different network buffer types and utilitarian travel, sedentary behavior, and leisure-oriented physical activity outcomes.},

Rapid sociodemographic and economic changes in Canada have created a need for planning strategies that allow for a greater degree of flexibility. Adaptability to changing market trends has now become extremely important to planners and developers of large subdivisions. The demands to permit quicker planning and approval processes are the motivating force behind this paper. The proposal simplifies the development and approval process by introducing a piecemeal approach to design and building\textemdash one that can easily be modified in accordance with market changes. Fundamental to the proposed concept is the argument that one cannot forecast market trends in the course of developing large communities. Rather than design subdivisions today and subject their developers to lengthy and costly change processes later, one can propose an approach that will allow change to occur with reduced intervention at a later stage. Rooted in the hierarchical principle, the proposed strategy integrates components with which both municipalities and developers are presently accustomed, but arranges them in a structure that reduces control as the scale of the development increases. The paper begins with an overview of the hierarchical principle which defines the relationships of the different elements that make up the city, in order to understand and envision the various options for urban growth. The development and design processes are outlined\textemdash first the conventional and then the alternative variations\textemdash followed by the conventional and proposed versions of the approval process. Organizing urban growth through a system of hierarchical progression allows flexibility and freedom in the design of staged developments in a manner which reflects the pace of construction and the needs of society at the time.},

  abstract = {This paper explores spatial properties of urban environments in relation to the occurrence of antisocial behaviour (ASB). This is a new approach depart from previous research which considers ASB predominantly from the socio-economic perspective. ASB, in contrast to crime, is a phenomenon which lacks clear formal definition - its borders to 'normal' or acceptable behaviour on the one end of the spectrum and criminal behaviour on its other end are blurred. What is perceived as 'antisocial' by the individual is typically highly subjective and depends on the observer's personal background (age, cultural background, gender etc). Sensitivity to disorder is also dependent on the backdrop of the urban scene - certain behaviour appears acceptable in certain environments whereas in others it is not. Any data set of reported ASB incidents is therefore inherently affected not only by lack of definition / definability of ASB and the reporting and recording practices, but also biased by the type of urban environment in which it takes place. Our findings suggests that, controlling for social differences, that patterns of ASB incidents can be correlated to physical properties of the environment, if we consider the environment in terms of its syntactical properties. We find generic patterns of incidents in different types of spatial layouts. We suggest that these patterns can be explained in the light of co-presence for pedestrians on the street and surveillance from residential entrances on the streets, with ASB withdrawing from both. This links our work to findings in the research on crime, and also to findings in the field of the social sciences: our findings might contribute to an understanding how communities organise in space and become 'socially effective' against disorder and crime.},

  abstract = {Doha, the capital of the State of Qatar, has faced enormous economic growth and rapid urban transformation over the last few decades. More recently, this has been accentuated by the construction of major urban public transit systems in the State and a desire to implement the Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) model in new developments and/or urban regeneration projects along the new `Doha Metro' rail network. A TOD is a mixed-use area planned to maximize access to public transport and encourage transit ridership. Scholars argue that TODs encourage sustainable urbanism via enhancement of livability by better integrating transportation and land-use strategies in urban form. This makes it critical to better understand the challenges and benefits that TODs offer for models of urbanism in formulating strategies and guidelines for the planning of sustainable settlements. This study focuses on one major new transit hubs in Qatar: West Bay, the waterfront business district of Doha, and its surrounding neighborhood. The aim of the research study is to evaluate the extent to which the new West Bay TOD will impact livability in the district and surrounding neighborhood. The findings provide a guide for the design and implementation of the TOD model in other districts of Doha to enhance livability for residents and citizens.},

  abstract = {There is a major housing affordability crisis in many American metropolitan areas, particularly for renters. Minimum parking requirements in municipal zoning codes drive up the price of housing, and thus represent an important potential for reform for local policymakers. The relationship between parking and housing prices, however, remains poorly understood. We use national American Housing Survey data and hedonic regression techniques to investigate this relationship. We find that the cost of garage parking to renter households is approximately \$1,700 per year, or an additional 17\% of a housing unit's rent. In addition to the magnitude of this transport cost burden being effectively hidden in housing prices, the lack of rental housing without bundled parking imposes a steep cost on carless renters\textemdash commonly the lowest income households\textemdash who may be paying for parking that they do not need or want. We estimate the direct deadweight loss for carless renters to be \$440 million annually. We conclude by suggesting cities reduce or eliminate minimum parking requirements, and allow and encourage landlords to unbundle parking costs from housing costs.},

  abstract = {Parking regulations are a central part of American zoning. There is mounting evidence about the negative effects of parking requirements on the environment and housing affordability. Given this evidence, some cities have reduced or eliminated parking requirements in certain areas. Our research examines how real estate developers respond to municipal parking reforms. We answer two questions. First, how do parking requirements affect the amount of parking provided in new residential developments? Second, how do developers' responses vary by building and neighborhood characteristics? This research analyzes Seattle, Washington (USA), the site of 2012 policy reforms that reduced or eliminated parking requirements in most central and transit-oriented neighborhoods. Our dataset consists of 868 developments with 60,361 housing units approved between 2012 and 2017. We use descriptive statistics, build a counterfactual scenario, and specify ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models to identify relationships between parking requirements and actual parking provision. We find that parking provision is closely, though not completely, tied to parking requirements. More than one-third of developments in the sample included the exact amount of required parking, including about two-thirds of developments subject to a minimum of one parking space per housing unit. About 70\% of developments with no parking requirements did include some parking. Parking requirements were the most important predictor of the actual quantity of parking provision in the regression results using the full sample. There was more parking provision in less dense and mixed-use developments, and in neighborhoods with higher employment densities. Seattle developers built 40\% less parking than would have been required prior to the reforms, resulting in 18,000 fewer parking spaces and saving an estimated \$537 million.},

The analysis is distinctive in that it takes seriously the emerging consensus among international housing scholars about the centrality of housing quality sub-market dynamics and spatial considerations. Received theory about the nature of housing sub-markets and their adjustments to policy interventions is used to critique previous evaluations of supply-and demand-side approaches and to provide fresh insights into their ability to achieve a wide variety of programmatic goals. Numerous dimensions of spatial considerations\textemdash externalities, area-wide abandonment and revitalisation, local reinvestment psychology, racial and economic integration and freedom of household locational choice\textemdash are applied to a further consideration of these two strategies, again using several alternative goals. Finally, the paper argues for the importance of context-driven housing policy formulation. Problem definition, goal weighting, and metropolitan housing market, socio-economic, and governmental characteristics collectively must be considered before an unambiguously `best' housing strategy can be identified. Nevertheless, the paper concludes that, with the typical context, the demand-side approach is superior to the supply-side approach.},

As a foundation for assessing both the causes of housing affordability problems and possible policies for alleviating them, we take a systematic, holistic perspective and specify nine structural relationships for a metropolitan area that comprehensively delineate the determinants of housing affordability. We discuss concepts and measures of housing affordability, evidence on the primary causes and effects of unaffordable housing, alternative policy approaches, potential future trends in affordability, and suggestions for further research. While focusing on the most recent, high-quality empirical evidence, we also rely on previously published reviews and seminal papers in order to provide historical perspective on how the literature has evolved. Our reconnaissance of the international literature since 2008 demonstrates that although evaluation research in the context of western, developed countries' housing policies has dominated, increasingly such research has emerged from other countries. Highlights We discuss how to frame housing affordability issues, synthesize evidence from the relevant literature, and propose directions for future research. We take a holistic perspective to understand causes of housing affordability problems and assess policy responses. Our review of the international scholarly literature encompasses the evidence from non-western, developing countries.

However, ongoing surveillance has revealed the emergence of variants harboring mutations in spike, the main target of neutralizing antibodies. To understand the impact of these variants, we evaluated the neutralization potency of 99 individuals that received one or two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines against pseudoviruses representing 10 globally circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2. Five of the 10 pseudoviruses, harboring receptor-binding domain mutations, including K417N/T, E484K, and N501Y, were highly resistant to neutralization. Cross-neutralization of B.1.351 variants was comparable to SARS-CoV and bat-derived WIV1-CoV, suggesting that a relatively small number of mutations can mediate potent escape from vaccine responses. While the clinical impact of neutralization resistance remains uncertain, these results highlight the potential for variants to escape from neutralizing humoral immunity and emphasize the need to develop broadly protective interventions against the evolving pandemic.},

The current approach is aimed at simulating these repercussions. For this purpose, a novel agent-based simulation tool includes common known strategies. This tool simulates the real-estate transactions from these strategies, showing the evolution of average prices and the results of each strategy (i.e. their success ratio, average price of their transactions and average waiting time). The underlying framework is extensible so that users can easily define and simulate new strategies. The experimentation of this work includes micro-validation of each kind of strategy. It also assesses this tool using a Spanish real-estate website (Idealista.com). The calibration of the tool was performed with the data of a small-medium city (Huesca), and the validation was performed for a different city (Teruel) to avoid overfitting. The results advocate that the current simulator might be an appropriate first step towards the simulation and analysis of the combination of certain buying and selling behaviors in the real-estate market.},

  abstract = {The United States spends more than \$250 million each year on the American Community Survey (ACS), a labor-intensive door-to-door study that measures statistics relating to race, gender, education, occupation, unemployment, and other demographic factors. Although a comprehensive source of data, the lag between demographic changes and their appearance in the ACS can exceed several years. As digital imagery becomes ubiquitous and machine vision techniques improve, automated data analysis may become an increasingly practical supplement to the ACS. Here, we present a method that estimates socioeconomic characteristics of regions spanning 200 US cities by using 50 million images of street scenes gathered with Google Street View cars. Using deep learning-based computer vision techniques, we determined the make, model, and year of all motor vehicles encountered in particular neighborhoods. Data from this census of motor vehicles, which enumerated 22 million automobiles in total (8\% of all automobiles in the United States), were used to accurately estimate income, race, education, and voting patterns at the zip code and precinct level. (The average US precinct contains {$\sim$}1,000 people.) The resulting associations are surprisingly simple and powerful. For instance, if the number of sedans encountered during a drive through a city is higher than the number of pickup trucks, the city is likely to vote for a Democrat during the next presidential election (88\% chance); otherwise, it is likely to vote Republican (82\%). Our results suggest that automated systems for monitoring demographics may effectively complement labor-intensive approaches, with the potential to measure demographics with fine spatial resolution, in close to real time.},

This study also conclude by emphasizing that urban planners and designer should consider the evolution of the city in the period of time and strategies learned from the past should be considered at the time of urban planners and designer. Therefore, through the investigation of the elements constituting traditional Islamic cities in Iran and the maintenance of these elements in the space of current cities, it is possible to find ways to make the environment be responsive to contemporary needs while it keeps its continuity and integrity with the historical structure and spaces.},

Nevertheless, the rapid growth of urbanization and other issues related to urban development have raised and augmented problems in these settlements. This situation is well understood in many Iranian cities in which the consequences of rapid urban growth and insufficient financial and human resources in the management process are obviously felt. The purpose of this research is to analyze the livability of Tehran Metropolis in terms of the fulfilment of biological needs with regard to land uses for residential purposes, urban infrastructures, sanitation, green spaces, industry, administration, transportation, military, and commercial purposes. To this end, initially the pattern of distribution of biological services all over Tehran Metropolis was analyzed using the Standard deviational ellipse method; and then, using the SAW technique, the livability of districts in Tehran was measured with respect to the fulfilment of biological needs. The findings of this research show that different districts of Tehran Metropolitan do not have similar conditions of livability regarding their access to biological services and these services have not been distributed among them equitably. The present study introduces the spatial districts which are high on the list of priorities and which require greater attention so as to promote just distribution of biological services in Tehran.},

The discussion seems to rest between two approaches. While planning should be flexible to facilitate a non-linear and multi-layered decisionmaking system, implementation should not be too flexible as the public sector might lose the controlling power and the private sector might gain increasing influence in urban development. This paper uses empirical data from case-based research on British, Spanish and Dutch urban regeneration projects, and provides an analysis of the effects of an important feature of flexibility on public-value capturing. Public-value capturing is the level at which public bodies manage to make developers pay for public infrastructure\textemdash infrastructure provision, public roads and space, public facilities and buildings, affordable and social housing\textemdash and eventually capture part of the economic value increase. This important aspect of flexibility is the level of certainty about future development possibilities before negotiations between developers and local planning bodies take place.},

This dramatically changed when scholars were able to quantify walkability with tools such as Walkscore\texttrademark; which measures how accessible daily living activities are by foot. The researchers investigated how walkability impacts the quality and sustainability of a neighborhood. They developed models that evaluated the correlation between an area's Walkscore\texttrademark{} and four broad measures of urban sustainability: neighborhood housing valuation; foreclosures; and crime. Our analysis shows a positive impact not only on neighborhood housing valuation but also on neighborhood crime and foreclosure. These results provide policy opportunities for planners and citizen groups to pursue strategies to encourage the development of more walkable and sustainable neighborhoods.},

In this paper we present a method to support the description and prescription of urban form that is contextsensitive, multi-dimensional, systematic, exploratory, and quantitative, thus facilitating the application of urban typomorphology to planning practice. At the core of the proposed method is the k-means statistical clustering technique to produce objective classifications from the large complex data sets typical of urban environments. Block and street types were studied as a test case and a context-sensitive sample of types that correspond to two different neighbourhoods were identified. This method is suitable to support the identification, understanding and description of emerging urban forms that do not fall into standard classifications. The method can support larger urban form studies through consistent application of the procedures to different sites. The quantitative nature of its output lends itself to integration with other systematic procedures related to the research, analysis, planning and design of urban areas.},

In this paper, we examine the increasing number of land-use regulations in Greater Boston. These regulations vary widely over space, and are hard to predict with any variables other than historical density levels. Minimum lot size and other land use controls are associated with reductions in new construction activity. These regulations are associated with higher prices when we do not control for contemporary density and demographics, but not when we add these contemporaneous controls. These results are compatible with economic theory, which predicts that production restraints on a good won't increase the price of that good relative to sufficiently close substitutes. Current density levels appear to be too low to maximize local land values.},

We employ a cost-based approach to gauge whether a housing market is delivering appropriately priced units.  Specifically, we investigate whether market prices (roughly) equal the costs of producing the housing unit. If so, the market is well-functioning in the sense that it efficiently  delivers housing units at their production cost. The gap between price and production cost can be understood as a regulatory tax. The available evidence suggests, but does  not definitively prove, that the implicit tax on development created by housing regulations is higher in many areas than any reasonable negative externalities associated  with new construction. We discuss two main effects of developments in housing prices: on patterns of household wealth and on the incentives for relocation to high-wage,  high-productivity areas. Finally, we turn to policy implications.},

In contrast, crowdsourced data from online platforms such as Yelp are often contemporaneous and geographically finer than official government statistics. In this paper, we present evidence that Yelp data can complement government surveys by measuring economic activity in close to real time, at a granular level, and at almost any geographic scale. Changes in the number of businesses and restaurants reviewed on Yelp can predict changes in the number of overall establishments and restaurants in County Business Patterns. An algorithm using contemporaneous and lagged Yelp data can explain 29.2 percent of the residual variance after accounting for lagged CBP data, in a testing sample not used to generate the algorithm. The algorithm is more accurate for denser, wealthier, and more educated ZIP codes.},

  abstract = {The design of suburban communities encourages car dependency and discourages walking, characteristics that have been implicated in the rise of obesity. Walkability measures have been developed to capture these features of urban built environments. Our objective was to examine the individual and combined associations of residential density and the presence of walkable destinations, two of the most commonly used and potentially modifiable components of walkability measures, with transportation, overweight, obesity, and diabetes. We examined associations between a previously published walkability measure and transportation behaviors and health outcomes in Toronto, Canada, a city of 2.6 million people in 2011. Data sources included the Canada census, a transportation survey, a national health survey and a validated administrative diabetes database. We depicted interactions between residential density and the availability of walkable destinations graphically and examined them statistically using general linear modeling. Individuals living in more walkable areas were more than twice as likely to walk, bicycle or use public transit and were significantly less likely to drive or own a vehicle compared with those living in less walkable areas. Individuals in less walkable areas were up to one-third more likely to be obese or to have diabetes. Residential density and the availability of walkable destinations were each significantly associated with transportation and health outcomes. The combination of high levels of both measures was associated with the highest levels of walking or bicycling (p{$<$}0.0001) and public transit use (p{$<$}0.0026) and the lowest levels of automobile trips (p{$<$}0.0001), and diabetes prevalence (p{$<$}0.0001). We conclude that both residential density and the availability of walkable destinations are good measures of urban walkability and can be recommended for use by policy-makers, planners and public health officials. In our setting, the combination of both factors provided additional explanatory power.},

  abstract = {This article presents Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots, a tool for visualizing the model estimated by any supervised learning algorithm. Classical partial dependence plots (PDPs) help visualize the average partial relationship between the predicted response and one or more features. In the presence of substantial interaction effects, the partial response relationship can be heterogeneous. Thus, an average curve, such as the PDP, can obfuscate the complexity of the modeled relationship. Accordingly, ICE plots refine the partial dependence plot by graphing the functional relationship between the predicted response and the feature for individual observations. Specifically, ICE plots highlight the variation in the fitted values across the range of a covariate, suggesting where and to what extent heterogeneities might exist. In addition to providing a plotting suite for exploratory analysis, we include a visual test for additive structure in the data generating model. Through simulated examples and real data sets, we demonstrate how ICE plots can shed light on estimated models in ways PDPs cannot. Procedures outlined are available in the R package ICEbox.},

We study a simple model for the probability that an individual in a city is employed in a given urban activity. The theory posits that three quantities drive this probability: the activity-specific complexity, individual-specific knowhow, and the city-specific collective knowhow. We use data on employment across industries and metropolitan statistical areas in the US, from 1990 to 2016, to show that these drivers can be measured and have measurable consequences. First, we analyze the functional form of the probability function proposed by the theory, and show its superiority when compared to competing alternatives. Second, we show that individual and collective knowhow correlate with measures of urban economic performance, suggesting the theory can provide testable implications for why some cities are more prosperous than others.},

Due to their ubiquity, GPS-enabled mobile devices are becoming promising for use as survey tools. TRAC-IT is a mobile phone application that records travel behavior by collecting real-time GPS data and requiring minimal input from the user for data such as trip purpose, mode of transportation, and vehicle occupancy. To ease survey burden on participants, new techniques must be explored to derive more information directly from GPS data. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of using neural networks and assisted GPS data collected from GPS-enabled mobile phones to automatically detect the mode of transportation. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates that this technique can be optimized using a critical point algorithm to reduce the size of required GPS datasets obtained from GPS-enabled mobile phones, thus reducing data collection costs while saving mobile phone resources such as battery life.},

Work in animals had suggested that their foraging might be explained in terms of a random walk, a mathematical rendition of a series of random steps, or a L\'evy flight, a random walk punctuated by occasional larger steps. The role of L\'evy statistics in animal behaviour is much debated \textemdash{} as explained in an accompanying News Feature \textemdash{} but the idea of extending it to human behaviour was boosted by a report in 2006 of L\'evy flight-like patterns in human movement tracked via dollar bills. A new human study, based on tracking the trajectory of 100,000 cell-phone users for six months, reveals behaviour close to a L\'evy pattern, but deviating from it as individual trajectories show a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity: work and other commitments mean we are not as free to roam as a foraging animal. But by correcting the data to accommodate individual variation, simple and predictable patterns in human travel begin to emerge. The cover photo (by Cesar Hidalgo) captures human mobility in New York's Grand Central Station.},

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

Market outcomes are consistent with strong demand for single-family detached housing units built on lots of 5,000 to 7,000 square feet, a lot size rarely allowed by local zoning laws. The four suburban cities we examine depart frequently from their written zoning codes in order to offer such lots, approving noncompliant subdivisions and making extensive use of customized regulation for planned unit developments. Scholars agree that large- lot zoning as practiced in exclusionary coastal jurisdictions is a binding constraint on density. We go further: even modest minimum lot sizes in automobile-oriented suburbs are less dense than Americans want.},

Three computationally heavy steps are involved: (i) simulating the model, (ii) estimating the likelihood and (iii) sampling from the posterior distribution of the parameters. Computational complexity of AB models implies that efficient techniques have to be used with respect to points (ii) and (iii), possibly involving approximations. We first discuss non-parametric (kernel density) estimation of the likelihood, coupled with Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling schemes. We then turn to parametric approximations of the likelihood, which can be derived by observing the distribution of the simulation outcomes around the statistical equilibria, or by assuming a specific form for the distribution of external deviations in the data. Finally, we introduce Approximate Bayesian Computation techniques for likelihood-free estimation. These allow embedding SMD methods in a Bayesian framework, and are particularly suited when robust estimation is needed. These techniques are first tested in a simple price discovery model with one parameter, and then employed to estimate the behavioural macroeconomic model of De Grauwe (2012), with nine unknown parameters.},

Using software development and machine learning techniques, the firm developed a plugin for Autodesk Revit to assist architects by allowing them to cross-reference any empty space against the firm's library of completed apartment designs. Nicknamed `Homegrown', this tool recommends apartment layouts used in similar spaces. Any apartment chosen by the user is then automatically reconstructed, adapted and post-rationalised to fit the target space. To further enhance the efficacy of this tool, feedback was collected from the firm's architects which was then used to refine the recommendation algorithm's feature weightings using various regression techniques. This paper gives an overview of the tool's development process and focuses particularly on its spatial analysis algorithm, which was developed alongside AHMM's architectural design teams. It attempts to answer the question: can architecture firms use heuristic techniques to develop new residential layouts based on existing designs, rather than generating them from first principles?}

Traditional theories of residential mobility suggest that mobility will occur when housing and transportation costs are cumulatively greater than the cost of moving to a new location. At the same time, the influence of these factors is not likely to be uniform across geographic contexts or for moves up or down the metropolitan hierarchy. Our analysis examines how well affordability measures explain patterns of county-level residential mobility. Specifically, we contrast conventional measures of affordability focused on the ratio of income to housing expense with measures of location affordability that factor in both housing and transportation costs. We find that whereas households tend to move from lower to higher cost locations, transit affordability at the destination plays an important role in mobility decisions.},

Given the topicality of this issue for policy-makers it is worth enquiring into precisely how far such narratives are in fact supported by a long-term perspective on historical changes in high street land uses in relation to the evolving spatial morphology of small town centres, in order to better distinguish the extent to which a further layer of socio-cultural explanation is required to account for the concern over `decline'. This research, undertaken as part of the EPSRC Adaptable Suburbs project at UCL, uses fully digitized historical maps, contemporary and historical land use data and space syntax analysis to identify historical-morphological parameters of change and continuity in and around two suburban high streets of Greater London since the nineteenth century: Surbiton and South Norwood. Drawing on Hillier and colleagues' theory of `movement economy, the contemporary English high street, as it is represented in the case-study areas, emerges as a distinctive and resilient spatial morphology which has supported varied modes of land use over time. It concludes that the narrative of high street decline in part reflects a dominant focus on difficulties facing the UK retail sector and that a broader focus on the high street as a (re)generative social space rather than simply as a `retail attractor' would allow for a broader appreciation of both its morphological and socio-economic capacities},

One of the most important pathologies, is hypercoagulation and microclots in the lungs of patients. Here we study the effect of isolated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit as potential inflammagen sui generis. Using scanning electron and fluorescence microscopy as well as mass spectrometry, we investigate the potential of this inflammagen to interact with platelets and fibrin(ogen) directly to cause blood hypercoagulation. Using platelet poor plasma (PPP), we show that spike protein may interfere with blood flow. Mass spectrometry also showed that when spike protein S1 is added to healthy PPP, it results in structural changes to {$\beta$} and {$\gamma$} fibrin(ogen), complement 3, and prothrombin. These proteins were substantially resistant to trypsinization, in the presence of spike protein S1. Here we suggest that, in part, the presence of spike protein in circulation may contribute to the hypercoagulation in COVID-19 positive patients and may cause substantial impairment of fibrinolysis. Such lytic impairment may result in the persistent large microclots we have noted here and previously in plasma samples of COVID-19 patients. This observation may have important clinical relevance in the treatment of hypercoagulability in COVID-19 patients.},

The framework is based on the evaluation and comparison of four main generative design algorithms. Effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through an example scenario. Compared to most existing generative design systems that are based on one of the techniques, which often bias the generative design process in a certain direction, new generative design systems by applying the proposed framework will provide the trigger at each stage as demonstrated in the example scenario for the designer to perceive the emergent designs from different viewpoints. This advantage will enhance design generation and automation by assisting the designer in making more informed decisions in understanding and selecting the suitable generative techniques for different design needs.},

  abstract = {Compact urbanization is the main strategy for sustainable urban development. However, it is yet unclear whether compact urban forms are ecologically more favourable than dispersed ones. In this paper, we studied the effects of urban sprawl on the riparian vegetation condition in one of the most degraded watersheds in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area, Argentina. We conducted random sampling of the riparian vegetation at sites along streams in the basin and assessed urban indicators at the reach and sub-watershed scales for each of those sites in a geographic information system: urban area, impervious surface, population density and two landscape metrics of dispersion. The indicators assessed explained a high proportion of the variability of the vegetation response variables, thereby confirming the importance of urban sprawl pressure in shaping riparian communities in fluvial ecosystems. Dispersed urbanization had more positive than negative effects on the vegetation in the study area. Riverbanks associated with dispersed urbanization had more plant species, including exotics, when urban sprawl was assessed at the local scale. At the sub-watershed scale, dispersed urbanized areas were richer in native plants and most of the functional groups, and poorer in exotic species. The model of the compact city, including bio-corridors along watercourses, has been proposed for the Buenos Aires conurbation process for the next decades. Our results showed that the quality of existing river corridors across the compact matrix was not desirable and best practices for redesigning a more sustainable landscape structure are necessary, including the restoration of habitats for wetland species.

Using both top-down and bottom-up approaches and scenarios, we examine building energy use for heating and cooling. Globally, the energy use for heating and cooling by the middle of the century will be between 45 and 59 exajoules per year (corresponding to an increase of 7\textendash 40\% since 2010). Most of this variability is due to the uncertainty in future urban densities of rapidly growing cities in Asia and particularly China. Dense urban development leads to less urban energy use overall. Waiting to retrofit the existing built environment until markets are ready in about 5 years to widely deploy the most advanced renovation technologies leads to more savings in building energy use. Potential for savings in energy use is greatest in China when coupled with efficiency gains. Advanced efficiency makes the least difference compared with the business-as-usual scenario in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa but significantly contributes to energy savings in North America and Europe. Systemic efforts that focus on both urban form, of which urban density is an indicator, and energy-efficient technologies, but that also account for potential co-benefits and trade-offs with human well-being can contribute to both local and global sustainability. Particularly in growing cities in the developing world, such efforts can improve the well-being of billions of urban residents and contribute to mitigating climate change by reducing energy use in urban areas.},

The lack of attention paid to policy design of the rental housing market causes low effectiveness in the housing resource flow and allocation at both local and national levels. Thus, we propose a novel design framework and process of public policy, in particular the development policy for the rental housing market. This innovative approach abstracts the policy design process into a solution-formation process for a high-dimensional and multi-objective optimization problem. First, based on opinion mining, using co-occurrence networks, text mining and other methods, in addition to authoritative literature and expert opinions from the Chinese Social Sciences Citation Index (CSSCI) as data sources, the objective function and the constraint function coefficients were determined to construct a multi-objective function of rental housing market policy. Second, this paper proposes a two-stage evolutionary high-dimensional multi-objective optimization algorithm based on the Pareto dominance relationship to solve high-dimensional multi-objective functions. Finally, we designed a rental housing policy tool-mix selection system-modeling process and obtained six sets of feasible solutions and objectives after 300,000 simulations. Therefore, the policy tool-mix selection system presented in this study effectively supports the policymaking process.},

  abstract = {Public transport has claimed a preferential position in recent urban development agendas internationally. Rising interest on inclusive development of cities at different levels of urban policy involves new opportunities and challenges for increasingly urban societies. In cities of the Global South, in addition to institutional and physical challenges for the development of efficient and inclusive public transport, local governments face the challenge of making public transport affordable for a large share of the population in conditions of poverty. In order to meet these challenges, several public transport systems throughout have implemented targeted subsidies for specific social groups such as students, the elderly and people with reduced mobility, and more recently for the poor. The government of Bogot\'a has implemented a pro-poor public transport subsidy scheme that aims at alleviating the financial burden of poor households for accessing the city's public transport system. This research develops an analysis of the effects of such subsidy from an accessibility perspective using potential accessibility measures to employment opportunities and assess its impact on equity. The research builds on the hypothesis that accessibility is a multi-dimensional construct that can benefit from the decrease in economic as much as gains in time costs. Results from the analysis show that both the current structure of the pro-poor subsidies in Bogot\'a and alternative scenarios for increasing its coverage are progressive, improving accessibility and equity for those with access to the subsidy. The paper provides valuable insights for the analysis of similar policies in other urban contexts in the Global South.},

Setting better conditions for pedestrians and cyclists has been related to many social benefits, such as less pollution and congestion. Local authorities, aware of the relationship between transport and land-use, are adopting planning tools to analyze growth in cities and their impacts using multiple indicators. This paper develops an econometric trip length model that correlates socioeconomic characteristics and built environment conditions with walking travel distances in the city of Bogot\'a, Colombia. A log-linear regression model was estimated using information for 2015 of Bogot\'a's household travel survey, along with data of employment and population by block obtained from official sources. The built environment component of the model serves to evaluate the effect of land-use patterns. A proof of concept was developed using land-use information extracted from a Cellular Automata Land-Use model calibrated for the city. From its results, some factors of the built environment were estimated and two scenarios were tested in this study. One depicts the average walking distance for households surveyed in 2015, and the other takes a simulation of land-use policy in developing a new urban area as an input. The results indicate that people living in areas were the land-use mix and job/population ratio are low, tend to have longer walking distances, suggesting the need to implement special policies that reallocate some activities and encourage higher land-use mix in the urban periphery where low-income households tend to be located. The proposed method can identify the impact of land-use policies in the distances traveled by walking, facilitating the impact assessment of land-use regulations.},

In this chapter, we review the literature on the causes and effects of this type of regulation. We begin with a discussion of how researchers measure regulation empirically, which highlights the variety of methods that are used to constrain development. Many theories have been developed to explain why regulation arises, including the role of homeowners in the local political process, the influence of historical density, and the fiscal and exclusionary motives for zoning. As for the effects of regulation, most studies have found substantial effects on the housing market. In particular, regulation appears to raise house prices, reduce construction, reduce the elasticity of housing supply, and alter urban form. Other research has found that regulation influences local labor markets and household sorting across communities. Finally, we discuss the welfare implications of regulation. Although some specific rules clearly mitigate negative externalities, the benefits of more general forms of regulation are very difficult to quantify. On balance, a few recent studies suggest that the overall efficiency losses from binding constraints on residential development could be quite large.},

Our findings yield important new insights into two outstanding issues in real estate finance and economics. The first deals with the implications for investment opportunities in housing across metro areas. A striking result is that we cannot reject the null hypothesis of equal appreciation rates across locales. A priori, the results are suggestive of equal expected appreciation across the different local markets. However, it is noteworthy that we find significant serial correlation in some local appreciation series. This is consistent with previous findings by Case and Shiller [6]and suggests that prescient market timers might have been able to make money in selective markets. We then consider the potential implications of equal appreciation rates across cities for housing market equilibrium in light of the fact that price levels do materially differ across metro areas. We argue that equal real appreciation rates starting from different price levels imply increasingly divergent prices of local traits in terms of foregone consumption. Without special assumptions with respect to income and productivity differentials across locations or to local trait income elasticities of demand, the appreciation rates in high housing price level areas ultimately have to fall below those in low price level areas. Preliminary evidence indicates that higher priced areas tend to have significantly lower appreciation rates (controlling for local fixed effects and a common, time-varying effect).},

Through densification and compact building, the approach aims to counteract negative effects of urban sprawl in terms of ineffective land-use and related environmental problems. In spite of its benefits various problems and challenges are associated with implementing the compact city approach. This review looks at the effects of urban densification and compact city development on urban green space and its planning. It identifies problems, challenges and strategies of urban green space planning during densification processes. Findings confirm that urban densification processes, including consolidation and infill development, can pose a threat to urban green space. However, the literature on the compact city approach often lacks specific suggestions for urban green space conservation and planning. Provision of urban green space in compact city environments and during densification processes is described as a major challenge. Loss of private urban green space rarely seems offset by provision of more public green space. Several ways are identified to deal with these challenges, while also highlighting research gaps, e.g., as to how loss of green space quantity can be offset by increased green space quality.},

It is the process of splitting a parcel or an allotment into smaller lots, each with its own separate title deed for the purpose of sale, residential development, and ownership transfer. Therefore, the act of partitioning has a significant role in the establishment of land-use activities. This research aims to introduce a simple and accurate algorithm to carry out land partitioning using a closed-form and direct solution procedure for any polygon-shaped parcel. The mathematical model is based on the coordinates of parcel vertices and some specified constraints to fulfill the site requirements and meet any regulations. The automation of this model was carried out in the Microsoft Visual Studio environment to handle the calculation of subdivision problems in accordance with some restrictions and conditions. In addition, to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, numerical applications were performed. Furthermore, an appropriate technique is discussed to eliminate discrepancies in parcel areas between what is registered in the ownership document and that computed from the corner coordinates.

  abstract = {The analysis of travel mode choice is an important task in transportation planning and policy making in order to understand and predict travel demands. While advances in machine learning have led to numerous powerful classifiers, their usefulness for modeling travel mode choice remains largely unexplored. Using extensive Dutch travel diary data from the years 2010 to 2012, enriched with variables on the built and natural environment as well as on weather conditions, this study compares the predictive performance of seven selected machine learning classifiers for travel mode choice analysis and makes recommendations for model selection. In addition, it addresses the importance of different variables and how they relate to different travel modes. The results show that random forest performs significantly better than any other of the investigated classifiers, including the commonly used multinomial logit model. While trip distance is found to be the most important variable, the importance of the other variables varies with classifiers and travel modes. The importance of the meteorological variables is highest for support vector machine, while temperature is particularly important for predicting bicycle and public transport trips. The results suggest that the analysis of variable importance with respect to the different classifiers and travel modes is essential for a better understanding and effective modeling of people's travel behavior.},

The distance separating different types of locations plays a crucial role in these interactions. Distance is the major factor that influences the values of interaction intensities. The question is how the intensities decrease with distance, since this decrease is usually not linear. This paper pursues the issues of the shape and parameters of the distance-decay functions based on daily travel-to-work transport movements, taking regional centres in the Czech Republic as the example. First the special distance-decay functions for individual regional centres are presented and discussed, followed by the expression of the universal distance-decay function approximating generally to the traits of the Czech settlement system and the nature of the interaction flows, i.e., travel-to-work. The expression of the universal function is based on the application of two easily accessible variables: population and number of jobs.},

We discuss the applicability of a procedural modeling pipeline of shape grammars in urban planning to derive meaningful 3D city models. Therefore we analyze CGA shape, a novel shape grammar for the procedural modeling of CG architecture, for its usage in architectural planning processes. Our system gives rise to three exciting applications in the field of city modeling and city visualization enabling a quick decision making and iterative design workflow: modeling of master plans, evaluation of built environments and planning of urban open spaces. It is capable to produce building shells with high visual quality and geometric detail. Context sensitive shape rules allow the user to specify interactions between the entities of the hierarchical shape descriptions. Selected examples demonstrate solutions to previously noted challenges.},

Predicted weather-related events like sea level rise, increased storm events, and extreme heat waves imply an urgent need for new approaches to settlement design to enable human and non-human species to adapt to these increased risks. A wide variety of policy responses are emerging at local and regional levels \textendash{} from sustainable urban form, to alternative energy production and new approaches to biodiversity conservation. However, little attempt has been made to ensure that strategies to adapt to the inevitable impacts of enhanced climate change (such as additional open space to enable water inundation) support ongoing policies intended to mitigate local contributions to climate change (such as attempts to increase urban densities to reduce car dependency). In some cases mitigation and adaptation are complementary but in other cases these policy goals may conflict. This research examined leading case examples of land-use plans and policies designed to address climate change. Focusing predominantly on cases from the United States and Australia, we identified whether the policies address adaptation, mitigation or both and whether the practices put mitigation and adaptation in potential conflict with each other. We found that half of the actions identified contain potential conflicts to achieving adaptation and mitigation simultaneously.},

We reviewed health-related articles that assessed (1) the relationships among urban form, air pollution, and health as well as (2) aspects of the urban environment (i.e., green space, noise, physical activity) that may modify those relationships.Recent FindingsSimulation and empirical studies demonstrate an association between compact growth, improved regional air quality, and health. Most studies are cross-sectional and focus on connections between transportation emissions and land use. The physical and mental health impacts of green space, public spaces that promote physical activity, and noise are well-studied aspects of the urban environment and there is evidence that these factors may modify the relationship between air pollution and health.SummaryUrban form can support efforts to design clean, health-promoting cities. More work is needed to operationalize specific strategies and to elucidate the causal pathways connecting various aspects of health.},

To the extent that a system works on non-correspondences it functions more probabilistically. It relies on numbers and frequencies of events which take place to reproduce a statistically stable global system, rather than on the formal clarity of its structure. This gives non-correspondence systems a robustness which highly structured systems do not possess. They can thus tolerate much more local disorder and yet be reproducible.},

  abstract = {Currently, China has 1334 vocational colleges. This accounts for 62.7 \% of all colleges and universities in China. A large portion of vocational colleges is represented by vocational education parks. In China, vocational education park refers to a zone that includes multiple vocational educational institutions and their corresponding science parks combined to form a set of teaching, training, research, production, and social services located in one area. Their development is closely tied to city development planning. Because China's vocational education system developed relatively late, there is little past experience with building vocational education parks. As a result, vocational education parks are introspective and self-enclosed with fragmented layouts, dispersed resources, insufficient facilities, and incomplete systems. This phenomenon is becoming increasingly serious. This article is based on research on public space layout expansion for Chinese vocational education parks using urban intensification strategies. The intent is to look at strategies for integrating educational resources, leveraging economies of agglomeration, and continuing development in a compact space by building shared facilities, improving the campus land-use ratio, curbing energy consumption and environmental pollution, containing campus sprawl, and promoting vocational education parks to develop in a healthy, orderly, and sustainable way. This study applies composition analysis techniques to three vocational education park design cases with public space layouts. The study provides a quantitative analysis of the overall and localized degree of space integration and uses these values to perform linear regression analysis. The intensification layout style stands out as a superior approach that establishes a relationship for the composition of public space in a vocational education park. This relationship's decisive influence is explored based on an analysis of the education and administration style of vocational schools. A model and optimization proposal is put forward within a certain scope for the degree of space integration with respect to the jointly coupled factors of space composition, education style, and school administration style. With vocational education park public space intensification as a goal and the ability to numerically evaluate data based on degree of integration, vocational education park design evaluation criteria can be established. From now on, the proposed vocational education park public space layout intensification method will provide a scientific and quantitative standard that will ensure a sustainable design strategy for China's characteristic vocational education parks.},

This study examines the role of appreciation expectations in overcoming the negative effects of nominal mortgage interest rates on house prices. Expectations of future appreciation are important determinants of house sales prices, remaining influential during periods of declining and moderating real prices, not just when prices are rising. The real rate of interest, as viewed by the homebuyer, is the mechanism for affecting change in housing price levels. Because the nominal interest rate is slow to reflect changes in expectations, these real rates vary over time. This ebb and flow of real interest rates appears to explain market price levels. Nominal rates play a role as well, primarily in the formation of appreciation expectations.},

Many considerations of the enclosure of the commons, however, have so far failed to account for a number of variables. For instance, the sensible management of common resources on a local scale may not function at all on a global one. Protecting forest biodiversity in areas populated by at-risk indigenous populations may call for trading off the protection of one commons for another. And commons also can be exclusionary, or can involve resources that are not scarce, such as intellectual property. In this essay, David Harvey argues that the real problem demanding our attention is private property, not the commons itself. The capitalist commons is being continuously enclosed, but it is also being continuously produced. To fulfill our common interests, we need to look to the powers of collective labor to address capitalism's destruction of land and labor resources.},

Firstly, we identified the nine strongly correlative factors of land price of Chengdu city. Secondly, we derived the land price for prediction. Thirdly, we compared the predicted land price with the real land price in the period of 2014-2015. Finally, the comprehensive land price of Chengdu in the period of 2017-2018 was forecasted with random forests and neural network, respectively. According to the results, we found that the error of the random forests is much smaller than that of neural network. Thus, we utilized random forests to predict the comprehensive land price of Chengdu in the period of 2017-2018. Our results showed that the comprehensive land price of Chengdu in the next two years would be stable and rises slightly.},

  abstract = {This paper outlines the application of an agent-based model (ABM) within the context of urban systems. The model is developed with the goal of exploring residential market dynamics under various scenarios, and addresses two issues of concern to Australian urban systems, namely interest rates and population growth. Simulated agents are faced with the selection of a residence, and use market and non-market factors in decision making. From the field of discrete choice theory, a preference based utility calculation is linked to the attributes of properties, as provided from GIS data and populated from a variety of secondary literature sources. In a second decision making step, the affordability of residences is calculated based on prevailing interest rates, and compared to income based thresholds for housing expenditure. The model highlights the benefits of micro scale simulation in the ability to represent and report not only the average outcomes of policy impacts, but how the impacts are distributed within the society, addressing the issue of `social gap'. Impacts of two sets of scenarios are examined, comparing different possible interest rate changes, and increases in population growth through immigration. It is shown that the ABM methodology is uniquely able to identify thresholds of change across varying scenarios, and offers particular value in the ability to communicate the distributive effects of impacts. A generic urban landscape and agent population is simulated using data from ABS, Brisbane DCDB and Sydney community profiles, with discussion on techniques and data sources to calibrate specific case studies. 134 1.},

Although it is known that the built environment influences children's travel behavior, there is scant knowledge of how urban form along children's commuting routes affects walking and cycling separately, or of how to incorporate urban form exposures in transport mode choice models. This research investigated (a) the associations between children's transport mode choice and urban form correlates en route, and (b) the consequences of different urban form operationalizations (i.e., individual variables, composite measure, and principal components [PCs]). Global Positioning System devices were used to track 623 trips to and from school made by Dutch children aged 6\textendash 11 years. Urban form exposures were derived with geographic information systems, and their relationships with mode choice were tested with mixed multinomial logit models in a cross-sectional research design. Differences between the number of associated urban form variables, their magnitudes, and their significance levels were found for both walking and cycling, independent of the operationalization. Urban form was most influential for walking, whereas distance-related effects were absorbed when modeled as PCs. The highest model fit was achieved through PCs; the composite measure resulted in the lowest fit. To maximize the effectiveness of planning and health interventions, walking and cycling must be targeted separately. Policymakers should avoid ``one-fits-all policies,'' which are deemed to be inefficient. Because urban form affects model interpretation and fit, careful attention should be paid to how urban form is modeled, and sensitivity analyses should be performed.},

  abstract = {The fact that accessibility shapes the geographic distribution of activity needs to be addressed in any long-term policy and planning for urban systems. One major problem is that current accessibility measures rely on the identification and quantification of attractions in the system. We propose that it is possible to devise a network centrality measure that bypasses this reliance and predicts the distribution of urban activity directly from the structure of the infrastructure networks over which interactions take place. From a basis of spatial interaction modelling and eigenvector centrality measures, we develop what we call a preferential centrality measure that recursively and self-consistently integrates activity, attraction and accessibility. Derived from the same logic as Google's PageRank algorithm, we may describe its operation by drawing a parallel: Google's PageRank algorithm ranks the importance of networked documents without the need to perform any analysis of their contents. Instead it considers the topological structure of the network and piggybacks thereby on contextualised and deep evaluation of documents by the myriad distributed agents that constructed the network. We do the same thing with regard to networked geographical zones. Our approach opens up new applications of modelling and promises to alleviate a host of recalcitrant problems, associated with integrated modelling, and the need for large volumes of socio-economic data. We present an initial validation of our proposed measure by using land taxation values in the Gothenburg municipality as an empirical proxy of urban activity. The resulting measure shows a promising correlation with the taxation values.},

The results from the instrumental variables specification, suggest that after controlling for household characteristics increasing residential density in the vicinity of the household location could increase gasoline consumption while increasing residential density at the metropolitan scale may reduce gasoline consumption. Interestingly, the land use diversity index does not seem to affect gasoline consumption. Put together, these findings are indicative of the potential risk of not taking advantage of high residential densities to, together with other strategies, reduce gasoline consumption in metropolitan areas in Mexico.},

This paper explores different options for modifying and extending classical cellular automata systems to support architectural form finding. It discusses the potential of cellular automata as generative design tools with respect to the questions: In which part of a design development, during which periods during a design process and in what roles do cellular automata promise desirable results from a practical standpoint? In response to these questions, a theoretical framework for the integration of cellular automata into the design process is presented. An implementation of a dialogue-based cellular automata-supported design process model is outlined and evaluated by remodelling an existing architectural design project.},

In this architectural context, urban form is shaped by architectural solutions that are developed in a copy-and-paste manner. To this background, cellular automata are introduced and discussed with respect to the specific potential of cellular systems to support architectural design addressing large projects as well as cost and speed constraints. Previous applications of cellular automata to architectural design have been conceptual and are typically limited by the rigidity of classical automata systems as adopted from other fields. This paper examines the generative design potential of cellular automata by applying them to the re-modelling of an existing architectural project. From this application it is concluded that cellular automata systems for architectural design can benefit from challenging and adapting classic cellular automata features, such as uniform volumetric high-resolution models and globally consistent rule execution. A demonstration example is used to illustrate that dynamic, state-dependent geometries can support an architectural design process.},

Simply put, new commons (NC) are various types of shared resources that have recently evolved or have been recognized as commons. They are commons without pre-existing rules or clear institutional arrangements. The paper introduces a map that outlines the NC resource sectors and identifies some of the salient questions that this new area of research raises. In addition, it examines the relationship between new commons and traditional common-pool resources and common property regimes. This overview includes a survey of the physical resources, the user communities, the literature, and some of the major collective action activities. Tacking new commons over several years has demonstrated that this vast arena is inhabited by heterogeneous groups from divergent disciplines, political interests, and geographical regions that are increasingly finding the term 'commons' crucial in addressing issues of social dilemmas, degradation, and sustainability of a wide variety of shared resources. The resource sectors include scientific knowledge, voluntary associations, climate change, community gardens, wikipedias, cultural treasures, plant seeds, and the electromagnetic spectrum. All of these new resource sectors and communities require rigorous study and analysis in order to better grasp the institutional nature of these beasts. This map is designed to serve as an introductory reference guide for future scholarly work.},

This paper sets out to systematically review accessibility measures that are used in hedonic price models (HPM), a method for estimating the implicit value of housing characteristics, such as location. From a systematic database search of peer-reviewed journal articles, we examined 54 articles that applies accessibility measures in hedonic price models that are based on three aspects of measure specification: type, impedance, and opportunities. We find that there are clear couplings between different impedances, types, and opportunities. We also noticed a tendency towards less advanced measurements, such as Euclidean distance and zonal measures, being used. Furthermore, we argue that these basic measures have a weaker connection to consumer perception, which is fundamental to the hedonic price approach. We also observed a lack of consideration to how this coupling between type, impedance, and opportunity could possibly affect the results. Theoretically, we can already conclude that some dominating impedances poorly relate to the fundamental theories of HPM, but this also points to the need for further research to empirically test the influence of the type-impedance-opportunity specification on the price estimates in HPM.},

As such, cities can be thought of as socio-technical systems. Any reasonable theory of urban complexity would need to link the social and technical sub-systems to each other. Historically, most urban models have sought to make the link through the concept of distance in the physical system as a cost in the social system, defining the physical sub-system as a set of discrete zones. Such models have proved practical tools, but over the years have contributed relatively little to the development of a more general theory of the city. Here we propose a more complex and, we believe, true-to-life model based on the definition of the physical sub-system of the city as a network of spaces \textendash{} streets and roads - linking buildings, rather than as a system of discrete zones. This allows us to approach urban complexity in a new way.},

This paper contains evidence in support of a new 'configurational' paradigm in which a primary property of the form of the urban grid is to privilege certain spaces over others for through movement. In this way it is suggested that the configuration of the urban grid itself is the main generator of patterns of movement. Retail land uses are then located to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the passing trade and may well act as multipliers on the basic pattern of 'natural movement' generated by the grid configuration. The configurational correlates of movement patterns are found to be measures of global properties of the grid with the 'space syntax' measure of 'integration' consistently found to be the most important. This has clear implications for urban design suggesting that if we wish to design for well used urban space, then it is not the local properties of a space that are important in the main but its configurational relations to the larger urban system.},

This suggests that topological and geometric complexity are critically involved in how people navigate urban grids. This has caused difficulties with orthodox urban modelling, since there it has always been assumed that insofar as spatial factors play a role in navigation, it will be on the basis of metric distance. In spite of much experimental evidence from cognitive science that geometric and topological factors are involved in navigation, and that metric distance is unlikely to be the best criterion for navigational choices, the matter has not been convincingly resolved since no method has existed for extracting cognitive information from aggregate flows. Within the space syntax literature it has also remained unclear how far the correlations that are found with syntactic variables at the level of aggregate flows are due to cognitive factors operating at the level of individual movers, or are simply mathematically probable network effects, that is emergent statistical effects from the structure of line networks, independent of the psychology of navigational choices. Here we show how both problems can be resolved, by showing three things: first, how cognitive inferences can be made from aggregate urban flow data and distinguished from network effects; second by showing unequivocally that urban movement, both vehicular and pedestrian, are shaped far more by the geometrical and topological properties of the grid than by its metric properties; and third by demonstrating that the influence of these factors on movement is a cognitive, not network, effect.},

  abstract = {The aim of this book is "to begin with architecture, and to outline a new theory and method for the investigation of society-space relation... First it attempts to build a conceptual model within which the relation can be investigated on the basis of the social contentof spatial patterning and the spatial content of social patterning. Second, it tries to establish, via a new definition of spatial order as restrictions on a random process, a method of analysis of spatial pattern, wit emphasis on the relation between local morphological relations and global patterns." (pp. x-xi) The analysis is applied to settlements, housing and so forth and shows that spatial patterns carry social information. Introduction Artefacts belong to 2 realms, practical use and style. They are both functional and meaningful. If they tend to be more of form than of use they are more for social use than for practical use and they become means by which cultural identities are known and perpetuated. see for instance Ottoman clocks - more for social use in early times Buildings are a special kind of artefact though. Building are in fact useful objects with social meaning but they carry another dimension: they order space and in that sense they are not just objects but transformation of space through objects. Ordering space really means the ordering of relations between people just like the ordering of time. Architecture is no a social art simply because buildings are important visual signs of society, but also becuase through the ways buildings create and order space, we are able to recognize society and see its form. Thus to analyze buildings is not merely to discuss their style and form but rather to deal with the social relations embedded in them. These deeper dimensions are mostly ignored as most architectual critics deal with the surface, with the image, rather than with the plan. (the plan as for it self is not enoug too, one has to decode its genotype) Anthropological and historical empirical data show that architecture and spatial patterns is not defined by exogonous factors such as climate, soil and technological skills, as different societies across time and space share remarkable similarities whenas different groups within the same ecological system differ in their spatial patterns. Levi Strauss has offered that the spatial formations are projections of social and mental processes but ackowleded the difficulty of studying societies throgh that lense as with some societies the connection is obvious and in others almost non existent, and yet others conciously invest more social meaning with the organization of space, etc. This type of structural anthropology is problematic in that it only deals with societies in which spatial patterns conform to social relations in a clear way, and in that it sees spatial patterns as a by product of something else which existence is anterior to the formation of space. Earlier theories of space were paradigmatic, i.e they set out from assumptions and presuppositions regarding nature, society and so forth, rather than from an empirical basis. The "territoriality" approach assumed that every individual or group tends to delimit his own sphere form which others should be expelled. Every identified social group should thus have a correspondig territory. The proble is that if it is a universal drive, how will the theory help to explain the differences in spatial configurations. Another problem is on the empirical level. Many groups were shown to exist without a territorial dimension. Terrioriality can only be seen as one specific case, rather than the rule. The cognitive approach emphasizes the way individuals and goups percept their enviorment but they seem to be doing this as a response to an enviorment already given. It cannot be a theoretical basis for an inquiry into the social logic of space. Another approach is to treat the enviromentas an object but here again the way this "object" was constructed by social relations is ignored. An opposite approach sees architecturesolely as a system of signs and symbols. So doing, the semiyotist miss the ways through which buildings strcuture social relations rather than just symbolize them. All these theories seperate society for enviroment the former being reduced to a mere abstraction (without spatial dimensions) and the latter being reduced to mere material. This is the man-enviroment paradigm. The basic model The theory here presented starts with the idea that a space may be configured based on a locla rule, for instance, combining cells to each other in a random way, leaving one side open, As a yard, to each cell/house. The pattern thus given is an example of how aptial patterns are in effect limits put on a random process. The more limits are put, the more order is created. And immidiately rises the question: who sets the rules, what is their nature? Obviously, this can be an aggregative process but also, a pre-designed one. The cells can be subodinate to a higher order, part of a larger cell. In this case the cell was contained within the inside of another cell whereas in aggregative processes cells can contain an opening with their outside (like in a plazza). The first case is a "inside" case and the second is a "between" case. The between case is called "distributed" becuase the "respnssibility for the pattern of the space is distributed between many primary cells. The "inside" case is called "nondistributed" becuase here it is one cell that governs the configuration of its insides. Another property implicit in this difference is that the between case implies symmetry: cell A is to cell B what cell B is to cell A. In the Inside case such relations do not exist. In short, this is the basis of a theory which can explain all spatial formations according to types of restrictions put on a random process. This is like identifying the genotypes which determine the nature of the process. The phenotypical variations may be numerous and thus, identifying the genotypes (i.e the restrictions on the random process) is easier. More order in a system means more restrictions put on the random process. The amount of social content invested in a given spatial order is can be explain by an extention of this model. If the different cells are interchangable the basic sentence specifying the genotype will be very short and general (every cell attached must have at least one open yard). The more cells are made un-interchangable, the more the genotype is complicated (every cell attached must have at least one open yard and cells of type A must be near cells of type C and cell H must have 4 yards aroud it etc.) For this model to be implemented a method for the quantative analysis of space was needed, and a comperhensive theory which explains how and why societies create their spatial order. Quantative analysis was bassed on the parameters of "distributement" and "symatry" (see p. 11). Space is intellegible if it is understood as being determined by two kinds f relations rather than one: 1. Relations between occupants 2. Relations between occupants and outsiders. This also governs te patterns of settlments. The interface between inhabitants and strangers was the single most important factor in the layout of the settlement. Through its spatial organization the space and the movement of strangers within it, could be controled. Here the system is to use both two dimentional (beads) and one dimentional (lines, axis) options to analyse the spatial organization. Why should the patterns be so different from one society to another? It is possible that different societies needed different types of control over human encounters in order for it to be the society it was. Here the theory relies on Durkheim and his distinction between organic solidarity and mechanical solidarity. Organic solidarity (based on interdependencce of differences, such as division of labor) created an integrated and dense space. Mechanical solidarity (based on similarities in beliefe and group structure) prefered a segregated and disperesed space. The spatial order of the inside is more structured, allows tighter control over encounters and avoidances whenas the spatial pattern of a settlment is looser, more fluid. The interior tends to define a more ideological space, in the sense of a fixed system of relations and catagories. The exterior is a transactioal space, a political space where catagories are negotiated. The exterior is where social relations are produced and the interior is whee they are reaffirmed by use (p. 20). There is at least a duality in the ways societies generate space and that is the result of their social solidarity. The role of the state: The state can be defined as "a global formation which projects both unified ideology and unified politics over a specific territoty." The more it acts to achieve these goals, the more the exterior is governed by a system of ideologically defined structures, and the more interiors are governed by controled transactions. Hence the distinction between power and control (p. 21).},

New techniques have been developed and applied to a wide range of architectural and urban problems. The aim of this book is to assemble some of this work and show how it leads to a new type of theory of architecture, an analytic theory in which understanding and design advance together. The success of configurational ideas in bringing to light the spatial logic of buildings and cities suggests that it might be possible to extend these ideas to other areas of the human sciences where problems of configuration are critical.},

It consists of three parts. Firstly, at a metatheoretical level, it is suggested that spatial organization should be seen as a member of a family of `morphic languages' which are unlike both natural and mathematical languages but which borrow properties from each. In general, morphic languages are used to constitute rather than represent the social through their syntax (that is the systematic production of pattern). Secondly, a general syntactic theory of space organization is proposed. It is argued that spatial patterns in both complex buildings and settlements fall into eight major types, which are interrelated in structural ways. Finally, the syntactic theory is used to integrate a number of recent general propositions made in anthropology regarding human space organization.},

  abstract = {While many large infrastructure networks, such as power, water, and natural gas systems, have similar physical properties governing flows, these systems tend to have distinctly different sizes and topological structures. This paper seeks to understand how these different size-scales and topological features can emerge from relatively simple design principles. Specifically, we seek to describe the conditions under which it is optimal to build decentralized network infrastructures, such as a microgrid, rather than centralized ones, such as a large high-voltage power system. While our method is simple it is useful in explaining why sometimes, but not always, it is economical to build large, interconnected networks and in other cases it is preferable to use smaller, distributed systems. The results indicate that there is not a single set of infrastructure cost conditions under which optimally-designed networks will have highly centralized architectures. Instead, as costs increase we find that average network sizes increase gradually according to a power-law. When we consider the reliability costs, however, we do observe a transition point at which optimally designed networks become more centralized with larger geographic scope. As the losses associated with node and edge failures become more costly, this transition becomes more sudden.},

Since about 2006, they have increased rapidly in popularity. They now go by many names: ecodistricts, \'ecoquartiers, eco-cities, zero/low-carbon/carbon-positive cities, ecopolises, ecobarrios, One Planet Communities, and solar cities. They have become frames\textemdash sometimes the dominant frame\textemdash used to orient the construction of new pieces of a city in a growing number of countries. Despite numerous standardization efforts, the field of ecourban neighbourhood planning and practice lacks a consistent cross-cultural understanding of what constitutes meaningful ecourbanism in specific economic, political, ecological, social, and design-based terms. Ecourban neighbourhood projects also respond to strictly local challenges and opportunities and express themselves in fragmented ways in different contexts. This article presents an original typology of ecourbanism as the integration of seven extreme type principles. We developed this typology through an abductive approach, or the back and forth testing of observed practices with arguments advanced in theories of sustainable development, planning and urban studies. While ecourban neighbourhood developments by definition express integrative goals, this typology permits assessment of the extent to which outcomes are being achieved in terms of each specific principle. We define and present a limiting case for each of these extreme type principles. Rather than attempting to render different standards equivalent across national contexts, this typology-based approach to understand the outcomes of ecourban neighbourhood developments promises a means to facilitate orienting these developments toward higher levels of integration within a common set of principled boundaries, as they are developed around the world.},

It discusses the apparent challenges in setting up a trans-disciplinary working-platform that cuts across profession-specific boundaries and negotiates between the otherwise distinct work-methodologies through the use of intelligent CAAD applications. Two approaches to architectural form finding have been combined in this research. The first, parametric design, uses a proprietary package as a key element to the organisation and reorganisation of architectural design. By doing so, it is providing it with intrinsic flexibility allowing designers to go beyond form and accommodate performance data for versioning. The second, ESO (Evolutionary Structural Optimisation), is an engineering tool based on the use of finite element analysis (FEA) capable of optimising the formal geometry of an object to obtain minimum volume under even stress-distribution through an iterative design process. In undertaking this research it became apparent that different levels of resolution need to be addressed in the form-finding process in order to investigate the full potential of the interactive use of parametric design and evolutionary optimisation. The case studies reflect this diversity and demonstrate more successes, limitations and future challenges within the transdisciplinary, collaborative effort.},

  abstract = {With the development of information technology, the ideas of programming and mass calculating were introduced into the design field, resulting in the upcoming of computer-aided design. With the idea of designing by data, we began to manipulate data directly, and interpret data through design works. Machine Learning, as a decision making tool, has been widely used in many fields. It can be used to analyze large amount of data, and predict the future changes. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a model frame in machine learning. It's specially designed to learn and generate output data with similar or identical characteristics. Pix2pixHD is a modified version of GAN that learns image data in pairs and generate new images based on the input. The author applied pix2pixHD in recognizing and generating architectural drawings, marking rooms with different colors and then generating apartment plans through two convolutional neural networks. Next, in order to understand how these networks work, the author analyzed the frame of them, and provide an explanation of the three working principles of the networks, convolution layer, residual network layer and deconvolution layer. Lastly, in order to visualize the networks in architectural drawings, the author derived data from different layer and different training epochs, and visualized as gray scale images. It was found that the features of the architectural plan drawings have been gradually learned and stored as parameters in the networks. As the networks get deeper and the training epoch increases, the features in the graph become more concise and clearer. This phenomenon may be inspiring in understanding the designing behavior of human.}

Current literature supports the Libertarian viewpoint by focusing on the ability of Bitcoin to bypass central authority and provide anonymity; rarely is there an examination of blockchain technology's capacity for decentralised transparency and auditability in support of a Socialist model. This paper conducts a review of the blockchain, Libertarianism, and Socialist philosophies. It then explores Socialist models of public ownership and looks at the unique cooperative properties of blockchain that make the technology ideal for supporting Socialist societies. In summary, this paper argues that blockchain technologies are not just a Libertarian tool, they also enhance Socialist forms of governance.},

The chief problem of the synoptic approach appears to be its lopsided application due to the difficulties of simultaneously bringing to bear other counterpart planning traditions. Each tradition resists blending with others; each has its own internally consistent, mutually sustaining web of methods, social philosophies, professional standards, and personal styles. Yet real world problems are not so consistent or self-contained. Effective solutions require diverse perspectives and multiple levels of action, extending beyond the scope of any contemporary American planning theory. A five-part classification of planning traditions is discussed under the heuristic rubric of SITAR, covering the Synoptic, Incremental, Transactive, Advocacy, and Radical schools of planning thought. Comparison is made of their relative strengths and weaknesses, revealing ways they are often complementary, but often strongly at odds. Contradictions among them are not seen to be deficiencies in the theories themselves, but reflections of homologous tensions and contradictions in society at large. Parallel application of more than one theory is usually necessary for arriving at valid, three-dimensional perspectives on social issues and appropriate action implications.},

  abstract = {National land use policies and strategies worldwide have attempted to establish a healthy housing rental market towards urban sustainability. Monitoring fine-scale housing rental prices should provide essential implications for equitable housing policies. However, doing so remains a challenge because aggregated data were traditionally collected at a coarse scale through census or social surveys. On-line housing rental websites (OHRWs) have become popular social media platforms in the housing studies. This paper attempts to demonstrate how to monitor fine-scale housing rental prices based on OHRWs using the case of Shenzhen in China. Employing hedonic model, a set of housing rental determinants are initially selected from three characteristics (neighborhood, location and structure) and at three levels (nearest accessibility, 15-minute walking distance availability and sub-district availability). Housing rent prediction models are then established (respectively for October 2017 and February 2018) using the training samples collected from the OHRWs and six machine-learning algorithms, including random forest regression (RFR), extra-trees regression (ETR), gradient-boosting regression (GBR), support vector regression (SVR), multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN) and k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN). Thereafter, the relative importance of the determinants is calculated and visualized using partial dependence plots. Finally, the models are used to monitor housing rental price dynamics for all of the communities within Shenzhen. Results show that all of the algorithms except SVR generally present good performance. Among them, RFR and ETR are the best one in October 2017 and February 2018, respectively. Concerning the spatial pattern of housing rental, the high-high clusters merge in the central districts, whereas the low-low clusters are located in the outskirts, and the growth rate is the greatest in the farthest outskirts from the central districts. Each determinant affects the housing rent across different scale and sub-district availability and nearest accessibility are more important than 15-minute walking distance availability. The two most influential determinants are sub-district job opportunity and nearest accessibility to health care facilities. The case of Shenzhen shows that the demonstrated framework, which integrates machine-learning algorithms and the hedonic modeling, is practical and efficient. The approach is believed to provide an essential tool to inform equitable housing policies.},

One strand of commons research focuses at the local scale, on small groups in ``traditional'', mostly rural societies; this research asks how commons are maintained over time. Another strand focuses on the commons at a global scale; this is political research that asks how commons can be reclaimed from a capitalist landscape. Here, I bridge these two approaches by theorizing the commons as reclaimed and maintained in the context of the city, through examining the experiences of limited-equity housing cooperatives in Washington, DC. I argue that the urban commons is marked by two distinct traits: it emerges in space that is saturated with people, competing uses, and financial investment; and it is constituted by the collective work of strangers. The challenges of reclaiming and maintaining an urban commons are substantial, but the need for them is urgent. Keywords:},

A commitment to principles of post-industrialism in the 1970s, realised through the conversion of False Creek South from an obsolescent industrial site to a medium-density, mixed-income residential landscape, effectively broke the mould of the mid-cen- tury urban core. The seminal Central Area Plan (approved 1991) enabled the comprehensive reordering of inner-city space, exemplified by a post-modern diversity, complexity and interde- pendency of territory and land use, and a strategic reversal of the employment\textendash housing imbalance in the core. The city has broadly succeeded in asserting public interests as contingen- cies of change within the core, but these processes have created new social conflicts, tensions and displacements, as well as a glittering and paradigmatic 21st-century central city. In theoretical terms, the Vancouver experience marks a clear break from the classic model of the post-indus- trial city, the latter typified by a monocultural, office-based economy, extreme spatial asym- metries of investment and development and modernist form and imagery. At the same time, emergent production clusters, residential mega-projects and spaces of consumption and spectacle in the central area present marked contrasts to the spatial disorder and chaotic patterns of `incipient' post-modernism, underscoring an exigent need for innovative and integrative retheo- risation.},

After two centuries of Leviathan-like public institutions or Welfare State, do we still need full delegation of every public responsibility and/or exclusive monopoly of the power to manage public affairs? In particular, is there space for a collaborative/polycentric urban governance matrix? In the ``sharing'', ``peer to peer'' ``collaborative'' age, there might be space for a new design of public institutions? Can urban assets and resources or the city as a whole be transformed into collaborative ecosystems that enable collective action for the commons?''. To investigate this question I chose the city, conceptualized as a commons, as an observation point. A large, developed urban city like Italy is a unique point of study. It is a large community of its own, and it is also developed of individual smaller communities that have their own networks.},

In our vision, environmental data must be available by everyone and shared with citizens, but it must be unmodifiable. We propose to solve the problem of the sensors data storage and management using a disruptive technology called blockchain. The blockchain responds to the demand of availability and unchangeability and, thanks to the potentiality of smart contracts, makes us able to manage sensor information and implement a control logic. In order to develop the software based on blockchain we chose to apply the SCRUM methodology because of its capabilities of being a flexible, adaptive and iterative methodology.},

The economics of climate action needs to be at the forefront of climate dialogue to prioritize investments among competing mitigation measures. A marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve is an effective visualization of climate action that initiates a technical and economic discussion of the cost-effectiveness and abatement potential of such actions among local leaders, policy makers, and climate experts. More commonly demonstrated for countries, MAC curves need to be developed for cities because of their heterogeneity, which vary in their urban activities, energy supply, infrastructure stock, and commuting patterns. The methodology for constructing bottom-up MAC curves for cities is presented for technologies that offer fuel switching and/or energy efficiencies, while considering technology lifetimes, city-specific electricity and fuel prices, and emission intensities. Resulting MAC curves are unique to every city, and chart the pathway towards low-carbon growth by prioritizing measures based on cost-effectiveness. A case study of Toronto's climate targets demonstrates the prioritization of select technologies. Leveraging MAC curves to support climate programs enables cities to strategically invest in financing climate action and designing incentives.},

Most of these studies find that both traditional land-use policies and newer policies, such as smart growth and inclusionary zoning, increase the cost of housing. And because housing takes up a larger share of the budgets of lower-income households relative to higher-income households, these policies are regressivea disproportionate share of their costs falls on the relatively poor.},

However some hypotheses can already be made, especially in the andrological field, for the biological similarity of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2. As well as SARS-CoV, SARS CoV-2 uses the `Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2' (ACE2) as a receptor to enter human cells. It was found that ACE2, Angiotensin (1-7) and its MAS receptors are present, over in the lung, also in the testicles, in particular in Leydig and Sertoli cells. A first hypothesis is that the virus could enter the testicle and lead to alterations in testicular functionality. A second hypothesis is that the binding of the virus to the ACE2 receptor, could cause an excess of ACE2 and give rise to a typical inflammatory response. The inflammatory cells could interfere with the function of Leydig and Sertoli cells. Both hypotheses should be evaluated and confirmed, in order to possibly monitor fertility in patients COVID-19+.},

  abstract = {A growing number of cities have set ambitious mid-century targets for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction and increased use of renewable energy. Using the municipal jurisdiction of Vancouver, Canada as a case study, we integrated an energy-economy model with an urban land-use and infrastructure model to test the possible actions resulting from policies potentially available to this city government in pursuit of its 2050 target of 100 percent renewable energy and an 80 percent reduction of GHG emissions. We found that, while cities like the one we studied have some important options for reducing energy use by their inhabitants, they may lack the authority to completely transform the energy system, especially for causing a wholesale switch to renewable energy for deep decarbonization. To achieve such ambitious energy and GHG targets, cities with jurisdictional powers comparable to the city we studied are dependent to some degree on complementary GHG and energy policies from senior levels of government.},

The model employs gravity-based accessibility and isolates differential effects of accessibility by retail type in submarkets on housing prices by controlling for housing attributes, location and transportation characteristics, and features of neighborhood land use. According to the results, the effect of accessibility by retail type varied across housing submarkets. The analysis highlights the importance of investigating accessibility effects by retail type at the housing submarket level. The results suggest that policies on mixed land use should take into account local contexts and complex relationships between retail type and housing prices within housing submarkets.},

In most cases, these approaches are investigated in isolation from one another. Recently, a number of researchers have attempted to couple these approaches, in order to enable larger numbers of street patterns to be generated and evaluated in an iterative loop. However, to date, the possibility of fully automating the generative-evaluative loop using optimisation algorithms has not been explored. This research proposes an explorative design method in which urban street patterns can be optimised for multiple conflicting performance criteria. The optimisation process uses evolutionary algorithms to evolve populations of design variants by iteratively applying three key procedures: development, evaluation, and feedback. For development, a generative technique is proposed for constructing street patterns. For evaluation, various performance measures are used, including in particular Space Syntax based Axial Line analysis. For feedback, a Pareto-ranking algorithm is used that ranks street patterns according to multiple criteria. The proposed method is demonstrated using an abstract scenario in which orthogonal street patterns are evolved for a small urban area.},

A clear link needs to be established between what a household can afford and the loan amount for which a household qualifies. This paper provides a conceptual review of three commonly used housing affordability indices in the United States: (a) the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Affordability Index for homeowners and renters; (b) the National Low Income Housing Coalition Affordability Index for renters, also known as Housing Wage; and (c) the National Association of Realtors Affordability Index for homeowners. The review of measures showed a lack of ability to easily adapt housing affordability measures to individual households. Discussions on issues related to housing affordability measures are presented, including market affordability verses individual affordability, the residual income approach, and housing affordability and transportation costs. The authors recommend that housing practitioners utilize an adapted residual income approach that considers household size, geographic location, transportation, and non-housing related expenses, rather than standard affordability measures or qualifying guidelines. The authors also recommend that researchers and policy makers review qualifying ratios and make appropriate changes to better determine an individual household's ability to afford housing.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the equity implications of a transition to a decentralised energy system in the UK. We base our analysis on one of three idealised transition pathways developed by the EPSRC-funded Realising Transition Pathways (RTP) project. Each pathway is characterised by a different mix of technologies, ownership and governance of the energy transition, and stretches from 2010 to 2050. In this paper we focus on the `Thousand Flowers' (TF) pathway, which stipulates a much greater role for civil society in the energy system. Here, civil society actors are instrumental in delivering 50 per cent of final electricity demand from decentralised, low-carbon sources by 2050. Such a radical and systemic transition will require both institutional as well as technological change. The systemic institutional transformation necessary to support wide-spread adoption of community/decentralised energy schemes and the potential distributional impacts have, however, received limited attention to date. To address this gap, we draw on collected outputs of the RTP consortium and extant literatures on community and decentralised energy to explore potential institutional barriers and distributional impacts of the TF pathway. We argue a transition to a TF future would require significant institutional changes to UK energy governance, new municipal and community business models, and new financial and organisational structures in energy ownership. Second, widespread adoption of distributed energy sources would undermine the viability of traditional large power plants; leading to the need for new forms of state support to maintain assets at transmission level. Finally, we contend that expanded community energy provision has the potential to reproduce, or even exacerbate, existing socio-economic and spatial inequalities.},

In doing so, I offer a case study for those concerned that TOD interventions could result in gentrification and the displacement of low-income groups. In this article I show how TOD policy has come to bear upon residents of a single rental apartment complex in Metro Vancouver's suburban City of Coquitlam, in British Columbia, Canada. This local case lies at a nexus of international migration, the Syrian refugee crisis, understandings of adequate refugee housing, and imaginaries of sustainable urban renewal. TOD policies are buttressed by arguments for smart growth and environmental sustainability, and in this case those arguments surmount social equity concerns. However, I question the impartiality of TOD logic requiring high-density residential redevelopment around rapid transit stations when residential intensification policies readily target areas of lower income renters, but are slower to affect areas of single-family homes. A mixed-methods research design of Geographical Information System (GIS) mapping, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions reveals a complicated set of circumstances in which TOD planning contributed to the displacement of Syrian refugees.},

This paper argues that it is essential to understand why people travel the way they do and not only be able to predict the overall activity patterns accurately. If one cannot understand the ``why?'' then a model's ability to evaluate the impact of future interventions is severely diminished. Bayesian networks (BNs) provide the ability to investigate causality and is showing value in recent literature to generate synthetic populations. This paper is novel in extending the application of BNs to daily activity tours. Results show that BNs can synthesise both activity and trip chain structures accurately. It outperforms a frequentist approach and can cater for infrequently observed activity patterns, and patterns unobserved in small sample data. It can also account for temporal variables like activity duration.},

  abstract = {The quest for livability is currently a key urban issue throughout the world. Judging from policy programs, political manifestos and business philosophies, maintaining or improving a city's degree of livability appears to be one of the main concerns of a variety of actors, ranging from the spheres of local and state government to civil society and business. Critical urban geographers have characterized livability as a `discursive frame that both enables and legitimates entrepreneurial policy initiatives'. Building on this critical interpretation of livability discourse this paper studies livability from the perspective of (urban) democracy. Through an investigation of the conceptual history of livability in the Netherlands, views on urban governance and citizenship are identified. The paper makes clear that over the past half a century, the concept of livability has played various roles in different contexts. In the late 1950s, livability emerged as a key concept in Dutch rural geography against the background of concerns over rural citizenship. In the 1960s and 1970s, livability was at the core of post-materialist values that rose to prominence in the urban arena. Urban social movements used the concept to contest the excesses of the prevailing growth-centered urban politics and the doctrine of modern functionalism. In the 1970s and 1980s livability was also used by urban government to promote a new kind of active citizenship, while in the 1990s livability was increasingly used by urban government and housing corporations to influence the social composition of urban neighborhoods.},

  abstract = {Informal settlement is a form of incremental urban design and planning that seems set to remain a primary mode of urban development in cities of the global South. Yet, we know very little about how incremental urbanism works. In this paper, we suggest a typology of increments as a conceptual lens for understanding the emergence of informal settlement morphologies. We consider the ways residents extend and renovate buildings at micro-spatial scales and identify typical increments of `extend', `attach', `replace', `divide', `connect' and `infill'. We also explore the informal rights and codes that govern the ways in which some increments encroach on public space \textendash{} `rights of way', `air-rights' and `the right to light and ventilation'. We engage with the paradox that while every increment is a form of upgrading, informal settlements often produce slum conditions. We suggest that the most effective knowledge base for slum upgrading practices lies in a better understanding of informal settlement as a mode of spatial production.},

However, previously developed bikeability indices do not account for cyclist-vehicle crash risk. This study aims to develop a comprehensive zone-based index to represent both biking attractiveness and cyclist crash risk. The developed Bike Composite Index (BCI) consists of two sub-indices representing bike attractiveness and bike safety, which are estimated using Bike Kilometers Travelled (BKT) and cyclist-vehicle crash data from 134 traffic analysis zones (TAZ) in the City of Vancouver, Canada. The Bike Attractiveness Index is calculated from five factors: bike network density, centrality, and weighted slope as well as land use mix and recreational density. The Bike Safety Index is calculated from bike network coverage, continuity, and complexity as well as signal density and recreational density. The correlation between the Bike Attractiveness Index and the Bike Safety Index in Vancouver is low (r = 0.11), supporting the need to account for both biking attractiveness and safety in the composite index.},

However, street configuration connects walkers with other built environments. Few studies have yet determined the effects on walking volume by measuring street configurations combined with other walking environments. Thus, by capturing spatial accessibility and centrality to pedestrian environments, this study determines how street configuration, combined with pedestrian environments, affects pedestrian mobility. Our multilevel regression models verify the positive effects of higher access to primary destinations, such as neighborhood retail stores, schools, cultural facilities, and available public transit along the local street network on walking volume. Furthermore, while areas with a higher volume of pedestrian accidents and nonresidential land use are the main venues for walkers, access to residential density and parks has negative or no effects on pedestrian mobility. Finally, the effects of spatial access to pedestrian environments varies with multiple neighborhood scales. The key findings imply the significance of spatial access to pedestrian environments on walking volume. Thus, policies to create pedestrianfriendly neighborhoods should consider the relationship between spatial access to pedestrian environments and walking behaviors.},

In addition, urban policies and designs for pedestrian-friendly urban settings have become a dominant paradigm to reshape urban environments. As retail sales depend considerably on the volume of neighborhood pedestrians, the link between pedestrian mobility and retail sales has been a key issue in studies, designs, and economic development of urban areas. Despite the importance of the topic, few empirical studies have examined how pedestrian volumes along street networks affect retail prosperity in urban spaces. Hence, this study investigates the effect of accessibility and centrality to walking volume on retail sales in Seoul by considering pedestrian volumes and street network configuration concurrently. Multilevel regression models confirm that spatial access to pedestrians has differing effects on retail sales according to the type of retail sector. Specifically, a higher accessibility to and visibility of retail stores for walkers tend to improve the sales performance of all retail types. Further, the sales of the Medical Services and Education sectors are remarkably sensitive to the combined effects of pedestrian and street configuration, unlike those of the three other sectors, namely Food, Retail, and Services.},

Although large amounts of interests have been paid in the house price modeling, limited work has focused on evaluating the price appreciation rate. In this study, we propose a data-fusion framework to examine how well house price appreciation potentials can be predicted by combining multiple data sources. We used data sets including house structural attributes, house photos, locational amenities, street view images, transportation accessibility, visitor patterns, and socioeconomic attributes of neighborhoods to enrich our understanding of the real estate appreciation and its predictive modeling. As a case study, we investigate more than 20,000 houses in the Greater Boston Area, and discuss the spatial dependency of house price appreciations, influential variables and their relationships. In detail, we extract deep features from street view images and house photos using a deep learning model, merging features from multi-source data and modeling house price appreciation using machine learning models and the geographically weighted regression at two spatial scales: fine-scale point level and aggregated neighborhood level. Results show that the house price appreciation rate can be modeled with high accuracy using the proposed framework (R2 = 0.74 for gradient boosting machine at neighborhood-scale). We discovered that houses with low house prices and small house areas may have a higher house appreciation potential. Our results provide insights into how multi-source big geo-data can be employed in machine learning frameworks to characterize real estate price trends and help understand human settlements for policy-making.},

  abstract = {The Grandview Woodland local area of Vancouver, British Columbia, is an area in transition. Retail, demographic, residential occupancy, and changes to built structures indicate that gentrification has escalated in the past seven years. Long standing impediments to gentrification, including industrial manufacturing, social housing, and crime, are not deterring change in this area to the extent they once did. This thesis examines how public policy has affected these changes in Grandview Woodland. Public policies embodied in laws and regulations have the capacity to either encourage or dissuade gentrification; however, other variables also influence gentrification making it difficult to determine the importance and influence of public policy in the process. This thesis uses semi-structured interviews and a document review in a case study of Grandview Woodland, to gain a better understanding of how public policies can influence gentrification in a local area where gentrification was previously impeded. The findings from this study suggest that public policies can have a substantial, but not autonomous, effect on gentrification in such an area. In Grandview Woodland, policy makers facilitate gentrification through city-wide and province-wide policies, including zoning changes, the Strata Title Act, and the Residential Tenancy Act. While these public policies have streamlined the advance of gentrification in Grandview Woodland, the catalysts for gentrification are the wider national trend of increased popularity of inner-city living, and the middle class moving eastwards in search of affordable homes in response to the massive property value increases in Vancouver's West Side.},

  abstract = {Energy use in cities has attracted significant research in recent years. However such a broad topic inevitably results in number of alternative interpretations of the problem domain and the modelling tools used in its study. This paper seeks to pull together these strands by proposing a theoretical definition of an urban energy system model and then evaluating the state of current practice. Drawing on a review of 219 papers, five key areas of practice were identified \textendash{} technology design, building design, urban climate, systems design, and policy assessment \textendash{} each with distinct and incomplete interpretations of the problem domain. We also highlight a sixth field, land use and transportation modelling, which has direct relevance to the use of energy in cities but has been somewhat overlooked by the literature to date. Despite their diversity, these approaches to urban energy system modelling share four common challenges in understanding model complexity, data quality and uncertainty, model integration, and policy relevance. We then examine the opportunities for improving current practice in urban energy systems modelling, focusing on the potential of sensitivity analysis and cloud computing, data collection and integration techniques, and the use of activity-based modelling as an integrating framework. The results indicate that there is significant potential for urban energy systems modelling to move beyond single disciplinary approaches towards a sophisticated integrated perspective that more fully captures the theoretical intricacy of urban energy systems.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an investigation into the integration of cellular automata in the architectural design process, specifically in the design of high density residential building forms. Addressing the complexity of cellular automata rule definition, we explore the potential of visual and diagrammatic descriptions to address density, accessibility and natural light in the architectural context. This paper reflects on the theoretical framework of cellular automata (CA) and what characterizes their application to architectural design. The intention is to develop a tool to support the adaptation of architectural requirements into CA principles. Focusing on the application of CA at the beginning of the design process, we outline the implementation of CA generating three-dimensional architectural form for a high density residential project in the Netherlands.},

  abstract = {Purpose Since its discovery in December 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally, causing the current COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-19) pandemic. As there is an increase of infections in the male population, concerns have emerged about the potential impact of COVID-19 on male reproductive organs and male fertility. Therefore, this study systematically investigates the current evidence of SARS-CoV-2 impact on male reproduction and pregnancy outcomes, discussing them in light of the evidence published on other coronaviruses. Materials and Methods Literature search was carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 24 original articles were included for the analysis, investigating the effects of the infection on semen parameters, male reproductive hormones, and pregnancy outcomes. Further, a Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) analysis was conducted based on the available evidence linking the virus with male reproduction and conception. Results Although there is limited data, viral mRNA has been identified in semen of infected men, with some evidence of altered seminal parameters. Low testosterone and dihydrotestosterone with raised luteinizing hormone has been reported as well as preterm delivery in pregnant women; however, data regarding vertical transmission remains contradictory and inconclusive. Conclusions The recent literature provides evidence that male gonads may be potentially vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection, recommending caution to pregnant women and couples planning natural pregnancy or assisted reproduction.},

However, little is known about whether these two factors are able to meet housing consumers\&rsquo; needs. This study aims to analyze how job accessibility and mixed land use satisfy housing consumers\&rsquo; needs. Particularly, this study investigates housing consumers\&rsquo; willingness to pay for these two features by using housing prices and rents in the Chicago metropolitan area. In order to deal with endogeneity between land use and housing prices and spatial autocorrelation between housing prices, spatial econometric models are used with instrumental variables. Interestingly, our findings show that an increase in job accessibility leads to an increase in housing prices, whereas it is not related to rents. We also found that mixed land use decreases housing prices, but increases rents.},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art deep learning methods have shown a remarkable capacity to model complex data domains, but struggle with geospatial data. In this paper, we introduce SpaceGAN, a novel generative model for geospatial domains that learns neighbourhood structures through spatial conditioning. We propose to enhance spatial representation beyond mere spatial coordinates, by conditioning each data point on feature vectors of its spatial neighbours, thus allowing for a more flexible representation of the spatial structure. To overcome issues of training convergence, we employ a metric capturing the loss in local spatial autocorrelation between real and generated data as stopping criterion for SpaceGAN parametrization. This way, we ensure that the generator produces synthetic samples faithful to the spatial patterns observed in the input. SpaceGAN is successfully applied for data augmentation and outperforms compared to other methods of synthetic spatial data generation. Finally, we propose an ensemble learning framework for the geospatial domain, taking augmented SpaceGAN samples as training data for a set of ensemble learners. We empirically show the superiority of this approach over conventional ensemble learning approaches and rivaling spatial data augmentation methods, using synthetic and real-world prediction tasks. Our findings suggest that SpaceGAN can be used as a tool for (1) artificially inflating sparse geospatial data and (2) improving generalization of geospatial models.},

  abstract = {Zoning regulations have been identified as a source of residential segregation in the United States. A common theme in the zoning literature is that municipalities adopt zoning regulations to exclude low-income and minority families. This study presents the first nationwide test for the presence of the exclusionary motive, using an existing dataset of land-use regulations in approximately 2,600 U.S. municipalities, and U.S. Census data on the demographics of the areas surrounding those municipalities. Geographic Information System (GIS) methods identify the demographics within a set radius of each municipality. This study uses a dataset of all school district desegregation court orders as indicators of municipalities' inclination and incentive to use land-use regulations to accomplish segregation. As a robustness check to address potential endogeneity of ethnic settlement patterns, this study employs a geographic instrumental variable. The results offer evidence of zoning to exclude low-income populations, but largely fail to provide empirical evidence of racially motivated land-use regulation.},

A variety of computational approaches have been proposed, including different forms of spatial analysis to evaluate the performance of design proposals, or the automated generation of urban design proposals based on specific parameters. However, most of these propositions have produced separate tools and disconnected workflows. In the context of urban design optimization procedures, one of the main challenges of integrating urban analytics and generative methods is a suitable computational representation of the urban design problem. To overcome this difficulty, we present a holistic data representation for urban fabrics, including the layout of street networks, parcels, and buildings, which can be used efficiently with evolutionary optimization algorithms. We demonstrate the use of the data structure implemented for the software Grasshopper for Rhino3D as part of a flexible, modular, and extensible optimization system that can be used for a variety of urban design problems and is able to reconcile potentially contradicting design goals in a semi-automated design process. The proposed optimization system aims to assist a designer by populating the design space with options for more detailed exploration. We demonstrate the functionality of our system using the example of an urban master-design project for the city of Weimar.},

Smart cities employ IoT based services and applications to create a sustainable urban life. By using information and communication technologies, IoT enables smart cities to make city stakeholders more aware, interactive and efficient. With the increase in number of IoT based smart city applications, the amount of data produced by these applications is increased tremendously. Governments and city stakeholders take early precautions to process these data and predict future effects to ensure sustainable development. In prediction context, deep learning techniques have been used for several forecasting problems in big data. This inspires us to use deep learning methods for prediction of IoT data. Hence, in this paper, a novel deep learning model is proposed for analyzing IoT smart city data. We propose a novel model based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict future values of air quality in a smart city. The evaluation results of the proposed model are found to be promising and they show that the model can be used in other smart city prediction problems as well.},

We find that cities that require a greater number of independent reviews to obtain a building permit or a zoning change have higher land prices, ceteris paribus. Finally, we relate the variation in land prices to the prices paid for housing in the region and show that local land use regulations are closely linked to the value of houses sold. This is in part because regulations are so pervasive, and also because land values represent such a large fraction of house values in the San Francisco Bay Area.},

Using a unique data set of new rental listings gathered from Craigslist and localized measures of the pandemic?s severity we find that, from mid-March to early June, local spread of COVID-19 is followed by reduced median and mean rent. However, this trend is driven by dropping rents for listings in Black, Latino, and diverse neighborhoods. Listings in majority White neighborhoods experience rent increases during this time. Our analyses make multiple contributions. First, we add to the burgeoning literature examining the rental market as a key site of perpetuating sociospatial inequality. Second, we demonstrate the utility of data gathered online for analyzing housing. And third, by reflecting on research that shows how past crises have increased sociospatial inequality and up-to-date work showing the racially and spatially unequal effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we discuss some possible mechanisms by which the pandemic may be affecting the market for rental housing as well as implications for long-term trends.},

The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine has demonstrated high protection levels, yet apprehension exists that several variants of concerns (VOCs) can surmount the immune defenses generated by the vaccines. Neutralization assays have revealed some reduction in neutralization of VOCs B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, but the relevance of these assays in real life remains unclear. Here, we performed a case-control study that examined whether BNT162b2 vaccinees with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection were more likely to become infected with B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 compared with unvaccinated individuals. Vaccinees infected at least a week after the second dose were disproportionally infected with B.1.351 (odds ratio of 8:1). Those infected between two weeks after the first dose and one week after the second dose, were disproportionally infected by B.1.1.7 (odds ratio of 26:10), suggesting reduced vaccine effectiveness against both VOCs under different dosage/timing conditions. Nevertheless, the B.1.351 incidence in Israel to-date remains low and vaccine effectiveness remains high against B.1.1.7, among those fully vaccinated. These results overall suggest that vaccine breakthrough infection is more frequent with both VOCs, yet a combination of mass-vaccination with two doses coupled with non-pharmaceutical interventions control and contain their spread.},

Although planning professionals have reached a rather consistent consensus on the structural characteristics of sustainable urban form, i.e. urban consolidation or densification policy, these goals are often not shared by inhabitants. The resistance by local residents towards densification is based on the fear of losing the environmental qualities that they appreciate without getting added value. We argue that a planning strategy that is sensitive to the local context and respects the inhabitants' place experiences can help in finding unique solutions and in restraining conflicts. To realize the context sensitive strategy, new kind of location-based information from residents is needed: experiential knowledge that is tightly anchored to specific places. In this study, 3119 respondents from the Helsinki metropolitan area participated in a Web-based survey that helped define the quality factors meaningful to inhabitants. The softGIS method used is an example of public participation GIS that allows the study of inhabitants' location-based experiences. The over 10,000 place experiences gathered were analysed in relation to the home locations of respondents and to the number of urban structural characteristics, including urban density, green structure proportion, and land-use patterns. The findings revealed that although green structure was experientially very valuable, densely built areas were also meaningful for inhabitants, especially in regard to social quality. We conclude that the `soft', experiential information can be a welcome addition to the other layers of information in evidence-based planning.},

Thus, we evaluated, in the light of the current urban space production conditions of Recife, an instrument of control and urban design already used by Municipal Urban Planning in the middle of the 20th Century: the so-called Urban Block Plan. Its application resulted in significant references of morphology and typology located in the Center of Recife and in some Neighborhood Centers. In the current crisis of urban space production in Recife, this instrument shows signs that it could once again contribute to an improvement in the relationship between the public and the private, between morphology and typology. In this way, we seek to establish the current and contemporaneous conditions of formatting, regulation and design parameters for the feasibility of we call the Condominium-Community Urban Block Plan or Community Block.},

This is mainly due to compositional changes in the populations of assisted and unassisted tenants. However, looking directly at rent changes at the dwelling level, rent changes are higher when new renters receive housing allowances. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that in the short run individual private landlords capture part of the subsidy.},

This study bridges in-situ observations of pedestrian activity and urban computing by integrating high-resolution, large-scale, and heterogeneous urban datasets and analyzing both fixed attributes of the urban landscape (e.g. physical and transit infrastructure) with dynamic environmental and socio-psychological factors, such as weather, air quality, and perceived crime risk. We use local pedestrian count data collected by the New York City (NYC) Department of Transportation (DOT) and an extensive array of open datasets from NYC to test how pedestrian volumes relate to land use, building density, streetscape quality, transportation infrastructure, and other factors typically associated with urban walkability. We quantify, classify, and analyze place dynamics, including contextual and situational factors that influence pedestrian activity at high spatial\textendash temporal resolution. The quantification process measures the urban context by extracting rich, yet initially fragmented and siloed, urban data for individual geolocations. Based on these features, we then construct contextual indicators by selecting and combining features relevant to pedestrian activity, and develop a typology of place to support the generalizability of our analysis. Finally, we use multivariate regression models with panel-corrected standard errors to estimate how specific contextual features and time-varying situational indicators impact pedestrian activity across time of day, day of the week, season, and year. The results provide insights into the key drivers of local pedestrian activity and highlight the importance accounting for the immediate urban environment and socio-spatial dynamics in pedestrian behavior modeling.},

In contrast to traditional methods, we introduce a recurrent convolutional neural network for text classification without human-designed features. In our model, we apply a recurrent structure to capture contextual information as far as possible when learning word representations, which may introduce considerably less noise compared to traditional window-based neural networks. We also employ a max-pooling layer that automatically judges which words play key roles in text classification to capture the key components in texts. We conduct experiments on four commonly used datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several datasets, particularly on document-level datasets.},

As a first approach, we combine these rules with the Upper Confidence Bounds applied to Trees (UCT) algorithm based on look-ahead trees. Our second approach converts these rules into a structured dynamic Bayesian network representation and predicts the effects of action sequences using approximate inference and beliefs over world states. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approaches for planning in a simulated complex 3D robot manipulation scenario with an articulated manipulator and realistic physics and in domains of the probabilistic planning competition.

This creates opposing forces that lead to sprawl in some models and increasing density in others. All models point to welfare increases, but also increases to energy consumption due to longer commutes, greater traffic congestion, and higher productivity, calling into question claims that autonomous vehicles will save energy. In most models, AVs lead to greater housing affordability by making suburban areas more accessible, and by reclaiming land that was previously used for parking.

To collect the data needed to evaluate street frontage quality at the city or regional level using traditional survey method is both costly and time consuming. As a result, this research proposes a pipeline that uses convolutional neural network to classify the frontage of a street image through the case study of Greater London. A novelty of the research is it uses both Google streetview images and 3D-model generated streetview images for the classification. The benefit of this approach is that it can provide a framework to test different urban parameters to help evaluate future urban design projects. The research finds encouraging results in classifying urban frontage quality using deep learning models. This research also finds that augmenting the baseline model with images produced from a 3Dmodel can improve slightly the accuracy of the results. However these results should be taken as preliminary, where we acknowledge several limitations such as the lack of adversarial analysis, labeled data, or parameter tuning. Despite these limitations, the results of the proof-of-concept study is positive and carries great potential in the application of urban data analytics.},

  abstract = {There has been a world-wide surge of interest in cycling over the last 10 years of which London has seen a continuous growth in cyclists and investment in infrastructure that has resulted in the introduction of the Barclays Cycle Superhighway and Barclays Cycling Hiring Scheme. Despite the investment in cycling infrastructure, there has been little understanding of cycling activity patterns in general and the effect of spatial configuration on cycling route choices. This research aims at measuring the impact of cycling infrastructure and spatial configuration on aggregate cyclist movement over two time periods. To do so, this paper presents a spatial-based cyclist movement statistical model that regress cyclist movement flows with measure of spatial configuration, safety and infrastructure and urban character attributes. Using Elephant and Castle, a Central London location, as a case study, the authors analyze cycling movement data sets from 2003 and 2012 to compare the change in cycling behaviour and the impact that the Cycling Superhighway 07, introduced in 2011, has had on cycling patterns. Findings confirm the growth of cycling in London with a 1000\% increase in cyclists along some routes in comparison to a 10\% increase in population at the same time. More importantly, results also suggest that higher cyclist movement were observed along routes with greater convenience and continuity\textemdash over and above route segregation from vehicular traffic. The relationship between spatial configuration and aggregate cyclists movement is consistent between 2003 and 2012 where spatial configuration have remained the same while changes were observed in both modal split and cycling infrastructure. This result is in line with previous research wherein aggregate higher cyclists movement are observed on major routes offering direct connections than less direct routes. From a spatial cognition perspective, this research enriches our understanding on how the external built environment as measured by the spatial configuration measure relates to aggregated cyclists movement overtime and in identifying key potential factors in influencing cyclist wayfinding.

In this study, we further develop the Street-Frontage-Net (SFN), a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can successfully evaluate the quality of street frontage as either being active (frontage containing windows and doors) or blank (frontage containing walls, fences and garages). Small-scale studies have indicated that the more active the frontage, the livelier and safer a street feels. However, collecting the city-level data necessary to evaluate street frontage quality is costly. The SFN model uses a deep CNN to classify the frontage of a street. This study expands on the previous research via five experiments. We find robust results in classifying frontage quality for an out-of-sample test set that achieves an accuracy of up to 92.0\%. We also find active frontages in a neighbourhood has a significant link with increased house prices. Lastly, we find that active frontage is associated with more scenicness compared to blank frontage. While further research is needed, the results indicate the great potential for using deep learning methods in geographic information extraction and urban design.},

  abstract = {When an individual purchases a home, they simultaneously purchase its structural features, its accessibility to work, and the neighborhood amenities. Some amenities, such as air quality, are measurable while others, such as the prestige or the visual impression of a neighborhood, are difficult to quantify. Despite the well-known impacts intangible housing features have on house prices, limited attention has been given to systematically quantifying these difficult to measure amenities. Two issues have led to this neglect. Not only do few quantitative methods exist that can measure the urban environment, but that the collection of such data is both costly and subjective. We show that street image and satellite image data can capture these urban qualities and improve the estimation of house prices. We propose a pipeline that uses a deep neural network model to automatically extract visual features from images to estimate house prices in London, UK. We make use of traditional housing features such as age, size, and accessibility as well as visual features from Google Street View images and Bing aerial images in estimating the house price model. We find encouraging results where learning to characterize the urban quality of a neighborhood improves house price prediction, even when generalizing to previously unseen London boroughs. We explore the use of non-linear vs. linear methods to fuse these cues with conventional models of house pricing, and show how the interpretability of linear models allows us to directly extract proxy variables for visual desirability of neighborhoods that are both of interest in their own right, and could be used as inputs to other econometric methods. This is particularly valuable as once the network has been trained with the training data, it can be applied elsewhere, allowing us to generate vivid dense maps of the visual appeal of London streets.},

Researches integrating geographical processes in machine learning models and the use of unsupervised approaches on geographical data for knowledge discovery had been sparse. This research contributes to the ladder, where we show how latent variables learned from unsupervised learning methods on urban images can be used for geographic knowledge discovery. In particular, we propose a simple approach called Convolutional-PCA (ConvPCA) which are applied on both street level and street network images to find a set of uncorrelated and ordered visual latent components. The approach allows for meaningful explanations using a combination of geographical and generative visualisations to explore the latent space, and to show how the learned representation can be used to predict urban characteristics such as street quality and street network attributes. The research also finds that the visual components from the ConvPCA model achieves similar accuracy when compared to less interpretable dimension reduction techniques.},

This paper offers an application of statistical meta-analysis in an attempt to settle the contradictory findings reported in the single studies.

The findings also reinforce the land use mixing component of the built environment as being a strong predictor of travel behavior.

To extract the relevant data attributes, this paper presents a method of acquiring public information data and real estate-related information, as provided by private real estate portal sites. The paper also proposes a pretreatment process required for intelligent machine learning. This report goes on to suggest an intelligent machine learning algorithm that predicts buildings' value pricing and future value by using big data regarding buildings' spatial information, as acquired from a database containing building value attributes. The algorithm's availability was tested by establishing a prototype targeting pilot areas, including Suwon, Anyang, and Gunpo in South Korea. Finally, a prototype visualization solution was developed in order to allow general users to effectively use buildings' value ranking and value pricing, as predicted by intelligent machine learning.},

Unfortunately for many people, housing is becoming harder and harder to afford, with some markets in Canada priced out of reach for entire generations of middle-income citizens. Affordable rental housing is also very difficult to come by, especially for people towards the bottom of the income distribution. Canada's rental stock of housing is old and deteriorated, with very little development or maintenance of this class of housing over the past 30 years. Governments at all levels affect housing in a variety of ways, and governments and citizens alike should be concerned about the extra cost added to housing through regulatory burden as well as other policies that limit new housing supply. Municipal governments add to the cost of housing through fees and levies and limit supply through zoning laws. This creates a fiscal externality on upper levels of government, since housing becomes less affordable and social spending requirements increase for provincial and federal governments. Provincial governments also interfere with the housing market. Land transfer taxes make land more expensive, and rent controls discourage investment in new rental housing developments. Vacancy and foreign buyer taxes are implemented in order to try to add supply to the rental market and limit speculative demand. Carbon taxes make building supplies\textemdash especially the key building ingredient of concrete\textemdash more expensive.},

In order for understanding of urban segregation to reach beyond residential segregation, the extent to which public space facilitates co-presence between social groups is a key issue. The main concern in this thesis is to arrive at a deeper understanding of the critical role urban form plays in terms of co-presence in public space and in extension for social segregation. The argument builds on knowledge from other fields, arguing that co-presence is of utmost importance for societal processes: by sharing space and being co-present with others, which does not necessarily imply focused interaction, we gain information and knowledge from our fellow citizens and participate in processes that negotiate social structures, acceptable behaviours and identities. The sharing of space thus becomes a central part of 鈥榖eing in society鈥. It is furthermore through public space that material urban resources are accessible, an access that is dependent on both the location of the amenities in space but also the distribution of space, as structured and shaped by urban form, which creates the actual experience of access through space.},

However, the mechanisms behind these two effects have never been made explicit in the literature. This paper proposes, for each claim, a plausible mechanism relying on the specific choices of housing suppliers and consumers. We propose that MPRs discourage small units because they eliminate the most profitable floorspace/parking bundle to supply to relatively lower-income households. We propose that parking costs may be passed on by reducing the supply of housing on offer at a given price.},

  abstract = {Researchers have responded to urban sprawl, congestion, and pollution by assessing alternatives such as smart growth, new urbanism, and transit-oriented development. Underlying this has been the presumption that, for these options to be given serious consideration as part of policy reform, science has to prove that they will reduce auto use and increase transit, walking, and other physical activity. Zoned Out forcefully argues that the debate about transportation and land-use planning in the United States has been distorted by a myth?the myth that urban sprawl is the result of a free market. According to this myth, low-density, auto-dependent development dominates U.S. metropolitan areas because that is what Americans prefer. Jonathan Levine confronts the free market myth by pointing out that land development is already one of the most regulated sectors of the U.S. economy. Noting that local governments use their regulatory powers to lower densities, segregate different types of land uses, and mandate large roadways and parking lots, he argues that the design template for urban sprawl is written into the land-use regulations of thousands of municipalities nationwide. These regulations and the skewed thinking that underlies current debate mean that policy innovation, market forces, and the compact-development alternatives they might produce are often 'zoned out' of metropolitan areas. In debunking the market myth, Levine articulates an important paradigm shift. Where people believe that current land-use development is governed by a free-market, any proposal for policy reform is seen as a market intervention and a limitation on consumer choice, and any proposal carries a high burden of scientific proof that it will be effective. By reorienting the debate, Levine shows that the burden of scientific proof that was the lynchpin of transportation and land-use debates has been misassigned, and that, far from impeding market forces or limiting consumer choice, policy reform that removes regulatory obstacles would enhance both. A groundbreaking work in urban planning, transportation and land-use policy, Zoned Out challenges a policy environment in which scientific uncertainty is used to reinforce the status quo of sprawl and its negative consequences for people and their communities.},

We demonstrate MAS that consists of agents representing organizations and interest groups involved in an urban allocation problem during a land use planning process. The multi-actor based decision-making is modelled by generating beliefs and preferences of actors about the location of and relation between spatial objects. This allows each agent to confront these beliefs and preferences with it's own desires and with that of other agents. The MAS loosely resembles belief, desire and intentions architecture. Based on a case study for a hypothetical land use planning situation in a study area in the Netherlands we discuss the potential and limitations of the MAS to build models that enable spatial planners to include the `actor factor' in their analysis and design of spatial scenarios. In addition, our experiments revealed the need for further research on the representation of spatial objects and reasoning, learning and communication about allocation problems using MAS.},

A regression analysis reveals that economic productivity is significantly associated with urban spatial structure. Conditioning on other factors, higher degrees of dispersion are associated with lower level of urban productivity whereas the effects of polycentricity depend on urban population density. Less densely populated cities are likely to have higher productivity levels when they are more monocentric, while urban productivity of cities with high population density tend to benefit from a more polycentric structure. The paper concludes with spatial planning implications.},

Based on multi-agent modeling theory, a model of the changes in urban safety livability is proposed to analyze the present situation and the trends in urban safety livability in complex urban systems. Considering safety as an example, five environmental indicators, namely public security, fire protection, traffic, emergency response, and residence, are selected. The interactive dynamic feedback mechanisms among resident decision-making behaviors and urban safety livability in the context of these five indicators and relevant policies are provided. A simulation of the changes in urban safety livability is implemented based on resident behaviors. The results show that the multi-agent modeling method is effective for analyzing urban safety livability and can provide decision support for urban development planning.},

We simulate the urban climate of various generated cities under the same weather conditions. For mono-centric cities, we propose a linear combination of logarithmic city area and logarithmic gross building volume, which also captures the influence of building density. By studying various city shapes, we generalise and propose a reduced form to estimate UHI intensities based only on the structure of urban sites, as well as their relative distances. We conclude that in addition to the size, the UHI intensity of a city is directly related to the density and an amplifying effect that urban sites have on each other. Our approach can serve as a UHI rule of thumb for the comparison of urban development scenarios.},

  abstract = {Graphs are fundamental data structures which concisely capture the relational structure in many important real-world domains, such as knowledge graphs, physical and social interactions, language, and chemistry. Here we introduce a powerful new approach for learning generative models over graphs, which can capture both their structure and attributes. Our approach uses graph neural networks to express probabilistic dependencies among a graph's nodes and edges, and can, in principle, learn distributions over any arbitrary graph. In a series of experiments our results show that once trained, our models can generate good quality samples of both synthetic graphs as well as real molecular graphs, both unconditionally and conditioned on data. Compared to baselines that do not use graph-structured representations, our models often perform far better. We also explore key challenges of learning generative models of graphs, such as how to handle symmetries and ordering of elements during the graph generation process, and offer possible solutions. Our work is the first and most general approach for learning generative models over arbitrary graphs, and opens new directions for moving away from restrictions of vector- and sequence-like knowledge representations, toward more expressive and flexible relational data structures.},

  abstract = {We estimate climate sensitivity from observations, using the deseasonalized fluctuations in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and the concurrent fluctuations in the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) outgoing radiation from the ERBE (1985-1999) and CERES (20002008) satellite instruments. Distinct periods of warming and cooling in the SSTs were used to evaluate feedbacks. An earlier study (Lindzen and Choi, 2009) was subject to significant criticisms. The present paper is an expansion of the earlier paper where the various criticisms are taken into account. The present analysis accounts for the 72 day precession period for the ERBE satellite in a more appropriate manner than in the earlier paper. We develop a method to distinguish noise in the outgoing radiation as well as radiation changes that are forcing SST changes from those radiation changes that constitute feedbacks to changes in SST. We demonstrate that our new method does moderately well in distinguishing positive from negative feedbacks and in quantifying negative feedbacks. In contrast, we show that simple regression methods used by several existing papers generally exaggerate positive feedbacks and even show positive feedbacks when actual feedbacks are negative. We argue that feedbacks are largely concentrated in the tropics, and the tropical feedbacks can be adjusted to account for their impact on the globe as a whole. Indeed, we show that including all CERES data (not just from the tropics) leads to results similar to what are obtained for the tropics alone - though with more noise. We again find that the outgoing radiation resulting from SST fluctuations exceeds the zerofeedback response thus implying negative feedback. In contrast to this, the calculated TOA outgoing radiation fluxes from 11 atmospheric models forced by the observed SST are less than the zerofeedback response, consistent with the positive feedbacks that characterize these models. The results imply that the models are exaggerating climate sensitivity.},

  abstract = {There is a growing debate about whether new housing units increase rents for immediately surrounding apartments. Some argue new market-rate development produces a supply effect, which should alleviate the demand pressure on existing housing units and decrease their rents. Others contend that new development will attract high-income households and new amenities, generating an amenity effect and driving up rents. In this paper, I contribute to this debate by estimating the impact of new high-rises on nearby residential rents, residential property sales prices, and restaurant openings in New York City. To address the selection bias that developers are more likely to build new high-rises in fast-appreciating areas, I restrict the sample to residential properties near approved new high-rises and exploit the plausibly exogenous timing of completion conditional upon the timing of approval. I provide event study evidence that for every 10\% increase in the housing stock, rents decrease 1\% and sales prices also decrease within 500 feet. In addition, I show that new high-rises attract new restaurants, which is consistent with the hypothesis about amenity effects. However, I find that the supply effect is larger, causing net reductions in the rents and sales prices of nearby residential properties.},

Unlike traditional trend following approaches, the proposed approach relies upon the mean reversion relation of financial markets. Equipped with online passive aggressive learning technique from machine learning, the proposed portfolio selection strategy can effectively exploit the mean reversion property of markets. By analyzing PAMR's update scheme, we find that it nicely trades off between portfolio return and volatility risk and reflects the mean reversion trading principle. We also present several variants of PAMR algorithm, including a mixture algorithm which mixes PAMR and other strategies. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to evaluate the empirical performance of the proposed algorithms on various real datasets. The encouraging results show that in most cases the proposed PAMR strategy outperforms all benchmarks and almost all state-of-the-art portfolio selection strategies under various performance metrics. In addition to its superior performance, the proposed PAMR runs extremely fast and thus is very suitable for real-life online trading applications. The experimental testbed including source code and data sets is available at http://www.cais.ntu.edu.sg/\texttildelow chhoi/PAMR/.},

This generally means that households can spend less than 20\% of their budgets on transport, or less than 45\% on transport and housing combined. Many households, particularly those with lower incomes, spend more on transport than is considered affordable. Several factors can affect transport affordability including the quality and price of transport options, land use accessibility, and housing affordability. Affordability is an important issue to transport system users, but conventional transport planning usually considers a limited set of costs and so is ineffective at evaluating overall affordability. More comprehensive analysis is needed for comprehensive affordability analysis. Research described in this report indicates that affordability increases with more accessible development and more multi-modal transport planning, and declines with sprawl and automobile dependency. Strategies that improve affordable modes tend to provide co-benefits.},

The system can generate simple 2D sketch shapes, which are generated by using general mathematical expressions, and selected shapes are dealt with to form 3D components. These components are classified and saved in a SQL sever based database (component base). The complex design is implemented via combination of different components that come from the component base. The layout of components is generated by a genetic algorithm. The generative process is illustrated through an architectural design example.},

Moreover, compared with other groups, the road transport activities of age group 35\textendash 49 are highly constrained by household income. The paper also shows that there is an inverted U-shape relationship between household CO2 road-related emissions and building densities. However, it indicates certain limitations on city planners when it comes to reducing household CO2 road-related emissions by bringing the downtown area closer. Moreover, the paper also identifies a so-called compensatory mechanism supporting the hypothesis that building densities have positive effects. Furthermore, the coefficient of low-density housing is positive and significant, implying that the private gardens of low-density housing might not be the reason for the hypothesized compensatory mechanism. However, this remains a question worth investigating.},

This article examines the limitations inherent in a functional (objective) notion of liveability that commonly underpins government policy directions. Through an examination of key debates in the literature we consider how the delivery of the social (subjective) dimension of liveability, linked to community, social interaction and social cohesion, poses unique challenges for policy makers, urban planners and developers. We argue for a deeper understanding of the social constructs of liveability that acknowledges the complexity of changing urban environments in contemporary society.},

Dense urban environments provide a complex settlement, where solar availability and urban daylight can become a scarce commodity, especially since buildings become increasingly taller. This is mainly due to the complex and dynamic overshadowing effects created on the building envelope. Accurately quantifying these effects could be the key to predicting reductions in solar availability which, in turn, can significantly affect daylight and the thermal performance of buildings, as well as the potential for PVs and other renewables sources. It is therefore necessary to use simulation tools in order to predict the mutual complex effects. In accordance with European building regulations, which are going toward a Net Zero Energy City, this paper presents a new design approach using generative modeling tools and dynamic simulation software in order to develop a sustainable urban planning method.},

Thus, the objective of the project presented here is to simulate the past and future transformation of suburban land use patterns in the Vienna Region. (The paper describes some results of the project, ``STAU-Wien'' (City\textendash Suburb relations and development in the Vienna Region), was carried out during 2000\textendash 2002). The paper discusses driving forces of suburban growth, and presents a model that simulates polycentric development of suburban systems. The model introduces different settlement growth velocities within the suburban region considering housing area densification and land use change from open space to built up area. In particular, the model takes into account suburban population migration and commercial start ups controlled by regional and local factors (attractiveness/constraints) in the suburban Vienna Region: large and small scale accessibility (traveling time to the core city, access to motorways), land prices, landscape attractiveness, social and commercial services supply, traffic exposure obstacles as well as (land use) zoning constraints. The approach concentrates on a Spatial Agent Model to stimulate regional migration and allocation decisions of households and commercial enterprises aiming in the selection of target municipalities. Land use change will finally be performed by a cellular automaton to decide on densification and land use change. The model has been developed and applied to simulate prior and future landscape transition processes for the suburban region in the surroundings of Vienna, Austria.},

However, most quantitative studies are based on just one city or a small set of cities, rather than a large number of cities that are representative of an entire country. With the increasing availability of new data, we aim to alleviate this gap by examining the impact of urban design upon economic vitality for the 286 largest cities in China by looking at a grid of geographical units that are 1\,km by 1\,km. We use these units and a set of new data (emerging big data and new data that reflecting urban developments and human mobility) to look at the impact of urban form indicators, such as intersection density (urban design), level of mixed use, and access to amenities and transportation, on economic vitality represented by activities using social media data. Our results show that these urban design indicators have a significant and positive relationship with levels of economic vitality for cities at every administrative level. The results contribute to a holistic understanding of how to improve economic vitality in cities across China at a detailed level, particularly at a time when China's economic growth will depend largely on growth of the service sector in urban areas. We think these results can help decision makers, developers, and planners/designers to improve economic vitality in cities across China.},

  abstract = {The ampler research, of which this study is the initial phase, aims to investigate the effect exerted by morphological changes over the way space is used, guided by the notion that patterns of encounter are organized by the architecture of the settlement and their relation with the architecture of the city. This paper addresses, specifically and comparatively, the space morphology and uses of two settlements that are part of a reallocation process in Natal (Brazil): a slum \textendash{} Favela do Maruim \textendash{} and a housing estate \textendash{} Residencial S\~ao Pedro \textendash{} built to accommodate the inhabitants removed from the former settlement. Favela do Maruim, a community mainly engaged in the fishing trade, located besides the river Potengi \textendash{} its raison d'\^etre \textendash{} dates from the 1940s. The 172 families that inhabited its 156 homes, are being transferred to the housing estate that comprises 200 flats (25 blocks), sited 700 meters away from their former community. The new settlement planned as a regular grid, was built in the context of a national housing programme, Minha Casa Minha Vida. As space may promote or hinder encounters, and believing that the day-to-day community life at open spaces was a vital part of the social life in Maruim, we investigate spatial attributes and relate them with uses in both settlements at three moments \textendash{} when the residents were living in the Favela, the housing estate present situation (with building fences), and as planned by the architects \textendash{} focusing the open spaces within and around their limits and their relationship with the global city. Axial and segment analysis characterized the insertion of each settlement in the city structure, at varying topological radii and metric distances, and their inner structures were examined through Visibility Graph Analysis. Although less orderly and integrated into the global urban tissue, the asymmetric and fragmented configuration of the favela irregular enclave defines a strong spatial hierarchy, which privileges certain convex open spaces as points of confluence for pedestrian routes and open-door activities. Not surprisingly, these spaces also show strong private/public interfaces. A different spatial logic guides the modern housing estate Residencial S\~ao Pedro, where a homogeneous order pulverizes uses. The study so far, therefore, indicates that, in this case, the morphological change can alter modes of use and encounter, and seems to inhibit community life.},

Numerous approaches exist that define principles for guiding sustainable development processes of urban neighborhoods. However, it remains unclear if these approaches really consider the core objectives that should be achieved and key actions that are involved to move toward sustainability. This study represents the first quantitative review that evaluates the principles for sustainable urban neighborhood development based on the available literature. We thus (i) identify promising approaches that present principles close to core criteria for sustainability and (ii) provide starting points for developing a more robust set of principles by bringing together the examined literature.

  abstract = {A proliferation of energy models has been developed across disciplines to explore energy~and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-reduction strategies in cities. Hybrid models are especially useful because they incorporate more dynamics to simulate realistic results~informed by relevant high-level policy decisions and building-level factors. Spatial and~aspatial energy models, however, are not often linked, which overlooks the spatial impact~of energy and emissions policies in urban environments. A new method is presented that~links these types of models to understand how building stocks change over time in response~to policies. This approach integrates outputs from an aspatial economic model, CIMS, with~buildings in a spatially explicit urban building energy model (UBEM), UMI. The energy\textendash economy model is parameterised against the UBEM using identified baseline condition~and proposed future policy interventions. Building stock replacement and retrofit change~are downscaled and disaggregated to individual buildings based on existing stock age and~a probability-based Markov chain model (MCM). This integration enables simulations of~cross-scale policy interventions that are sensitive to both economically and mechanically~driven factors. An application of this approach shows how it can be used to evaluate how~different policies interact with and influence building energy demand and GHG emissions. ~ Practice relevance The results are integrated as a series spatially explicit energy modeling procedure (UMI) at~the neighborhood scale. This process enables local assessments of efficacy of the proposed~city scale and even regional policies in municipalities with various energy and GHG emission~agendas. In the presented case study (of the Sunset neighborhood of Vancouver, BC,~Canada) this method can quantify the elasticity of emission reductions from various urban~form changes (e.g. infill, transportation-oriented development, etc.), new building code (i.e.~BC Energy Step Code), active transportation and retrofit strategies from 2020 to 2050.},

Whether creating vibrant plazas seemingly overnight or re-imagining parking spaces as neighborhood gathering places, they offer a way to gain public and government support for investing in permanent projects, inspiring residents and civic leaders to experience and shape urban spaces in a new way. ~Tactical Urbanism, written by Mike Lydon and Anthony Garcia, two founders of the movement, promises to be the foundational guide for urban transformation. The authors begin with an in-depth history of the Tactical Urbanism movement and its place among other social, political, and urban planning trends. A detailed set of case studies, from guerilla wayfinding signs in Raleigh, to pavement transformed into parks in San Francisco, to a street art campaign leading to a new streetcar line in El Paso, demonstrate the breadth and scalability of tactical urbanism interventions. Finally, the book provides a detailed toolkit for conceiving, planning, and carrying out projects, including how to adapt them based on local needs and challenges. ~Tactical Urbanism will inspire and empower a new generation of engaged citizens, urban designers, land use planners, architects, and policymakers to become key actors in the transformation of their communities.},

This paper uses the U.S. as a case study to explore the challenges of, and prospects for, filling that gap. Its main questions are: 1) Can a scan of existing built environment indicators yield a catalog of high-quality indicators that measure sustainability comprehensively? and 2) What gaps and challenges arise and how can they be overcome? The study triangulates answers through a review of sustainability literature, a scan of existing indicators, and consultation with panels of indicator experts. Results suggest that U.S. built-environment indicators do not robustly track local progress toward sustainability, confirm deficiencies in the equity dimension, and provide recommendations that allow communities in the U.S. and internationally to more successfully track their local progress toward sustainability goals.},

  abstract = {Homology between human and viral proteins is an established factor in viral- or vaccine-induced autoimmunity. Failure of SARS and MERS vaccines in animal trials involved pathogenesis consistent with an immunological priming that could involve autoimmunity in lung tissues due to previous exposure to the SARS and MERS spike protein. Exposure pathogenesis to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 likely will lead to similar outcomes. Immunogenic peptides in viruses or bacteria that match human proteins are good candidates for pathogenic priming peptides (similar to the more diffuse idea of ``immune enhancement''). Here I provide an assessment of potential for human pathogenesis via autoimmunity via exposure, via infection or injection. SAR-CoV-2 spike proteins, and all other SARS-CoV-2 proteins, immunogenic epitopes in each SARS-CoV-2 protein were compared to human proteins in search of high local homologous matching. Only one immunogenic epitope in a SARS-CoV-2 had no homology to human proteins. If all of the parts of the epitopes that are homologous to human proteins are excluded from consideration due to risk of pathogenic priming, the remaining immunogenic parts of the epitopes may be still immunogenic and remain as potentially viable candidates for vaccine development. Mapping of the genes encoding human protein matches to pathways point to targets that could explain the observed presentation of symptoms in COVID-19 disease. It also strongly points to a large number of opportunities for expected disturbances in the immune system itself, targeting elements of MHC Class I and Class II antigen presentation, PD-1 signaling, cross-presentation of soluble exogenous antigens and the ER-Phagosome pathway. Translational consequences of these findings are explored.,                                        \textbullet{}               All SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic epitopes have similarity to human proteins except one.                                         \textbullet{}               Roughly one-third of the potentially targeted human proteins (putative autoantigens) are key players in the adaptive immune system.                                         \textbullet{}               The list of viral/human protein matches provides clues on which epitopes or parts of epitopes might be involved in the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 disease from SARS-CoV-2 infection.                                         \textbullet{}               It also indicates which epitopes might be responsible for autoimmunological pathogenic priming due to prior infection or following exposure to SARS-CoV-2 or relatives following vaccination.                                         \textbullet{}               These epitopes should be excluded from vaccines under development to minimize autoimmunity due to risk of pathogenic priming.},

Working within the context of largescale corporate development projects, public sector planners are proactively shaping development to be dense but also conform to notions of livability that derive from traditional urbanism, such as `eyes on the street' and pedestrian scale. Design guidelines have resulted in new building types that integrate ground-floor townhouses into very large buildings. This study analysed how the new embedded townhouse forms are contributing to life on the street and neighbourhood livability, using environmental measurements, behaviour observations and surveys. The findings conclude that the embedded townhouses do contribute to livability, although other aspects of the building types and neighbourhoods may pose concerns.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to elucidate the pathophysiology that underlies severe COVID-19 by assessing the histopathology and the in situ detection of infectious SARS-CoV-2 and viral capsid proteins along with the cellular target(s) and host response from twelve autopsies. There were three key findings: 1) high copy infectious virus was limited mostly to the alveolar macrophages and endothelial cells of the septal capillaries; 2) viral spike protein without viral RNA localized to ACE2+ endothelial cells in microvessels that were most abundant in the subcutaneous fat and brain; 3) although both infectious virus and docked viral spike protein was associated with complement activation, only the endocytosed pseudovirions induced a marked up-regulation of the key COVID-19 associated proteins IL6, TNF alpha, IL1 beta, p38, IL8, and caspase 3 in endothelium. Importantly, this microvasculitis was associated with characteristic findings on hematoxylin and eosin examination that included endothelial degeneration and resultant basement membrane zone disruption and reduplication. It is concluded that serious COVID-19 infection has two distinct mechanisms: 1) a microangiopathy of pulmonary capillaries associated with a high infectious viral load where endothelial cell death releases pseudovirions into the circulation, and 2) the pseudovirions dock on ACE2+ endothelial cells most prevalent in the skin/subcutaneous fat and brain that activates the complement pathway/coagulation cascade resulting in a systemic procoagulant state as well as endothelial expression of cytokines that produce the cytokine storm. The data predicts a favorable response to therapies based on either removal of circulating viral proteins and/or blunting of the endothelial-induced response.},

  abstract = {Understanding how congestion at one location can cause ripples throughout large-scale transportation network is vital for transportation researchers and practitioners to pinpoint traffic bottlenecks for congestion mitigation. Traditional studies rely on either mathematical equations or simulation techniques to model traffic congestion dynamics. However, most of the approaches have limitations, largely due to unrealistic assumptions and cumbersome parameter calibration process. With the development of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and Internet of Things (IoT), transportation data become more and more ubiquitous. This triggers a series of data-driven research to investigate transportation phenomena. Among them, deep learning theory is considered one of the most promising techniques to tackle tremendous high-dimensional data. This study attempts to extend deep learning theory into large-scale transportation network analysis. A deep Restricted Boltzmann Machine and Recurrent Neural Network architecture is utilized to model and predict traffic congestion evolution based on Global Positioning System (GPS) data from taxi. A numerical study in Ningbo, China is conducted to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Results show that the prediction accuracy can achieve as high as 88\% within less than 6 minutes when the model is implemented in a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU)-based parallel computing environment. The predicted congestion evolution patterns can be visualized temporally and spatially through a map-based platform to identify the vulnerable links for proactive congestion mitigation.},

The findings show that walkability indices are highly correlated with walking trips for most non-work trip purposes, although socio-demographic characteristics also play a key role. Additionally households with more mobility choices are more sensitive to their surroundings than those with less choice.

We identify two main concepts of grammar application in urban design and outline their characteristics. We conclude that a generic or context-independent approach to shape grammars can provide high levels of flexibility and interaction with the user. This, coupled with their ability to encode different layers of information, facilitates their use for design exploration and problem solving in an urban context.},

In addition to present the methods and compare analyses with real peoples' bicycle routes, we show results from applying these methods in actual urban design. In conclusion, the analyses capture streets networks' potential for containing useful bicycle routes and are highly useful for evaluating urban design proposals that include street network layout. By this, we hope to contribute to the further methodological development of space syntax tools as well as to provide explicit knowledge about urban form and non-motorised transportation.},

  abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: Zoning laws that require onsite parking spaces with every residential unit arguably inhibit housing development in center cities and make housing that is built both more uniform and expensive. I test this idea using data from a natural experiment in Los Angeles. In 1999, Los Angeles freed old vacant commercial and industrial buildings in its downtown from all parking requirements if converted to residential use. Using both an original survey and interviews with planners and developers I first document the extent to which these buildings were turned into housing, then compare parking provision at these converted buildings with parking requirements for other downtown housing. I find that developers used deregulation to create thousands of housing units in previously disinvested areas of downtown Los Angeles and departed substantially from conventional parking zoning, mainly by providing parking offsite. I also find strong evidence that units in deregulated buildings are less likely to offer parking, and mixed support for the idea that units without parking are smaller and offered at lower prices. Takeaway for practice: The case study lends credence to arguments that parking requirements create barriers to housing development. Policymakers should be particularly interested in the influence of locational requirements on parking. The biggest departure from the zoning code was not in how many spaces developers provided, but where they provided them. Research support: The University of California Transportation Center funded this research.},

  abstract = {In light of the urgent threats presented by climate change and rapid urbanisation, interest in 'smart city systems' is mounting. In contrast to scholarship that poses 'smartness' as something that needs to be added to cities, recent developments in spatial morphology research pursue a view of the built fabric of cities as an extension of the cognitive human apparatus, as well as a material formulation of social, cultural and economic relations and processes. The built fabric of cities needs to be understood as a highly intelligent artefact in itself, rather than simple, dead matter. The current focus on high-tech systems risks concealing the fact that the machine is already there. In contrast to the technological 'implements' of smart city systems, this article looks at cities as 'facilities' \textendash{} that is, as technologies that slow down, store and maintain energy as a resource for a variety of purposes. The article builds on space syntax research in order to give precision to the understanding of the affordances the cities offer their various processes and the ways in which cities operate as information storage and retrieval devices for individuals and for society. The city must be considered, we argue, in terms of a range of tangled, interdependent systems, reaching from individual buildings to the whole city, an understanding anchored in notions of 'diversity' and 'density' (recently gathered under the concept of 'spatial capital') and in research addressing how the distribution of space and artefacts serve as means of knowledge communication (specifically, in complex buildings such as libraries and department stores). In conclusion, we argue that existing discussions on 'smart city systems' would benefit acknowledgement of the role of cities as facilities.},

However, it is argued here that most approaches to sustainable urbanism still share the conception of the humans-environment relations that characterized modernism. The paper finds support in recent knowledge developments in social-ecological sustainability, spatial analysis and cognitive science to initiate a dialogue for an alternative framework. Urban form engages humans not only through physical activities, but also mentally through opportunities for learning and creation of meaning, thereby both reinforcing and impeding behaviours on a cognitive level. Against this background, it is proposed that what in cognition studies is termed `cognitive affordances' could form the core of a new epistemological framework of the human-environment relation in sustainable urbanism.},

  abstract = {Land is, besides labour and capital, one of the classic production factors in economic theory. However, neoclassical economics dominating the 20thcentury, simplified production theory to only labour and capital, treating land either as just another form of capital or as the natural resources it harbours. This hides the central role of land \textendash{} in the meaning of spatial extension and location \textendash{} for contemporary economies, where land rent is an essential cost and location a productive factor for most economic activities, not least since these increasingly are located in cities. Critical here is the confusion often found concerning property values and the distinction between land and improvements, the latter most often constituted by buildings, where buildings quite naturally can be treated as capital, while land cannot. Importantly, while property value can be increased by its owner through improvements, such as new buildings, she is very limited in influencing the land value, since this is a collective variable dependent on the economic development of the city as a whole. It is here proposed that improvements on land in contemporary urbanised economies to a dominant degree concern systems of centrality and accessibility generating relative locations, that are further enhanced by buildings and land division, and that this constitutes what is proposed to be called a spatial capital, which to a large degree is created through the practices of urban planning and design.{$<$}br /{$>$}In this paper we investigate the dependency of spatial form on land value. First, we review how spatial form and the configurations of accessibility it generates on land, influences housing prices to find support for the intimate relationship between relative location and monetary market values. Second, we investigate the dominance of land values compared to improvement values in four Swedish cities of different size Third, we investigate how known parameters of spatial form correlates with land values in Gothenburg, Sweden. We see close associations between spatial form and land values, both in shape of market housing prices and as property taxation values. Land value holds a larger share of total property taxation value in larger cities, suggesting that relative location is valued higher where economic activity is greater. Furthermore, we find clear correlations between spatial form and land taxation values. Altogether, these findings indicate that spatial capital encompasses monetary value. In extension, these findings also indicate how knowledge based and skilful urban planning and design can create measurable value.},

This role has then grown further, thanks to the irruption of sustainable topics nominating urban morphology as a disciplinary `plug-in' between architecture, urban design and landscape. Urban morphology can thus be a valuable tool connecting the technological aspects typical of sustainable strategies to the various cultural, social, civic and formal aspects of urban design and architecture. That is why teaching urban morphology in a sustainable perspective is of the upmost importance. An educational methodology, morphologically-based, allows students and practitioners to develop a design and sustainable culture within the body of the architectural discipline giving them the needed awareness to face with the wide and complex topic of sustainability.},

Use case results confirm that blockchain will disrupt urban networks, like Cybernetics did in 1948, Ekistics a decade later, and the Metabolists and Webbists in the late sixties. The Ubiquitous Computing arrived later, in the seventies, and disrupted all the previous network efforts, lasting until the current Internet of Things (IoT) and its sister concept Smart Cities, when IoT is used in an urban context.

One advantage of the proposed methodology is that the framework links broad sustainability and livability goals with transportation objectives as well as to associated livability indicators and variables. Such a comprehensive framework facilitates a better understanding of what can be done to improve regional performance of transportation and transit infrastructure. For illustrative purposes, this paper then assesses the extent to which TODs in Denver are satisfying livability concerns and begins to characterize the policies and planning that have led to these differing outcomes. Denver is an advantageous case study because it represents a second-generation mass transit system in a region that is fighting intense auto-dependence. The analysis presents the performance of the Denver system with its associated TODs from a broader and more comprehensive perspective that facilitates insight into how transportation goals can be better understood and realized by transportation managers.},

The task of city planning becomes how best to generate and maintain the functional complexity possessed by cities. To address this, we need to understand both the complexity of cities, and the ways in which functional complexity could be generated through planning. This chapter first discusses three ways in which urban complexity could be considered beneficial: through perceptual richness, functional capacity and synergy. Then, four kinds of organised complexity are suggested\textemdash `artefactual' complexity, system complexity, biological complexity and ecological complexity\textemdash within which the nature of urban complexity may be articulated. Three consequences of complexity are then discussed: these relate to the unknowability of the system as it is, the unknowability of effects of intervention, and the unknowability of an optimal future state. Finally, the chapter considers how planning could generate functional complexity. It is argued that a system of planning that involves not only design (master-planning) but coding and development control (involving increments of generation and selective feedback) can be recognised as an `engine of complexity', creating something `organic', intricate, iterative, adaptable, and hence functional\textemdash but more like evolution than design. It is suggested that recognising the positive benefits of a complex system of planning, capable of generating functional urban complexity, could help avoid mistakes of the past so that `planning' is itself not part of the problem, but part of the solution.},

It is found that although the individual texts are more or less scientific, the way the field as a whole combines and uses these can be interpreted as pseudo-scientific. The article reflects on the interpretation of pseudo-science and suggests the need for urban design to have a better system of validation and critical assimilation of scientific knowledge.},

These studies investigate a wide range of phenomena using a wealth of data and diverse analytical techniques. Starting within the fields of transport or infrastructure engineering, street networks have commonly been treated as sets of more or less homogeneous linear elements, connecting locations and intersecting at junctions. This view is commonly represented as a graph, which provides a common and rigorous formalisation accessible across disciplines and is particularly well-suited for problems such as flow optimisation and routing. Street networks are, however, complex objects of investigation and the way we model and then represent them as graphs has fundamental effects on the outcomes of a study. Many approaches to modelling street networks have been proposed, each lending itself to different analyses and supporting insights into diverse aspects of the urban system. Yet, this plurality and the relation between different models remains relatively obscure and unexplored. The motivations for adopting a given model of the network are also not always clear and often seem to follow disciplinary traditions. This paper provides an overview of key street network models and the prima facie merits of pertinent alternative approaches. It suggests greater attention to consistent use of terms and concepts, of graph representations and practical applications, and concludes with suggestions for possible ways forward.},

Zone planning in permaculture design, according to Mollison (1988), consists on the definition of abstract boundaries around a home to cover certain functions of the landscape according to the frequency and the need to use them. Those zones are usually intuitively designated by how accessible each area is from the house. Accessibility is therefore a key factor on the conception phase of permaculture designs. Space syntax analysis (Hillier and Hanson, 1984) was applied to explore accessibility relations in order to redesign the garden according to those zoning guidelines, which allows for objectively defining spatial delimitations in sites of different sizes. Visibility Graph Analysis helped to identify the most efficient spots for installing closed-circuit television cameras in order to achieve constant surveillance of the house surroundings. It was also applied to define dimension and placement of openings in the house so that the house dwellers could enjoy the best views of the garden. The study seeks to contribute towards the question of applying such analytical procedures for designing single-family housing units by discussing some of its potentials and limitations.},

  abstract = {O modo de produ\c{c}\~ao e o tipo de consumo de alimentos e energia el\'etrica s\~ao exemplos de sistemas produtivos diretamente relacionados a projetos da arquitetura e da paisagem que vem se mostrando insustent\'aveis ao longo do tempo. Este estudo busca entender como uma adequa\c{c}\~ao na arquitetura e no paisagismo de unidade habitacional unifamiliar localizada no bairro Tirol, Natal, pode fornecer alternativas vi\'aveis para um modo de morar mais resiliente e sustent\'avel atrav\'es de uma maior autonomia de recursos h\'idricos, energ\'eticos e horticulturais. Conforme Nicole Foss (2015), a melhor alternativa para lidar com os problemas causados pelos sistemas insustent\'aveis est\'a na ado\c{c}\~ao de pr\'aticas produtivas mais resilientes, ou seja, sistemas locais de produ\c{c}\~ao das necessidades b\'asicas. O estudo se desenvolveu em quatro etapas principais: (1) a defini\c{c}\~ao de um modo de morar resiliente, pela lente da permacultura, e adequa\c{c}\~ao deste modo aos problemas relatados nas entrevistas com os usu\'arios; (2) a an\'alise da demanda horticultural e o estudo preliminar de um jardim ecol\'ogico horticultural (fig. 3 lado esquerdo) e contemplativo (fig. 3 lado direito) baseado nas necessidades dos usu\'arios, nos princ\'ipios da permacultura (Mollison, 1988) e zoneado com o aux\'ilio de an\'alises configuracionais (Hillier e Hanson, 1984) (fig. 2); (3) a proposta de capta\c{c}\~ao de energia solar, a etiquetagem do n\'ivel de desempenho ambiental conforme o Regulamento T\'ecnico de Qualidade do INMETRO (2012) e diretrizes projetuais para atingir o desempenho ambiental n\'ivel A do edif\'icio (fig. 1) e (4) o sistema capta\c{c}\~ao e armazenamento de \'aguas pluviais e reaproveitamento de \'aguas cinzas (fig. 4). O trabalho conseguiu unir diferentes \'areas da Arquitetura e Urbanismo - tais como projeto paisag\'istico, morfologia do ambiente constru\'ido, conforto ambiental e instala\c{c}\~oes hidr\'aulicas - na busca de uma alternativa vi\'avel ao modo de morar contempor\^aneo insustent\'avel.},

  abstract = {As Vilas Ol\'impicas constru\'idas para os jogos do Rio de Janeiro (Condom\'inio Ilha Pura, CIP, 2016) e Vancouver (Southeast False Creek, SFC, 2010) receberam a certifica\c{c}\~ao LEED-ND para desenvolvimento de vizinhan\c{c}a sustent\'avel com base em crit\'erios de avalia\c{c}\~ao pensados para promover comunidades habit\'aveis e sustent\'aveis. Considerando que a obten\c{c}\~ao dessas qualidades \'e parcialmente dependente das propriedades morfol\'ogicas e funcionais que facilitam movimento, visibilidade e encontros entre sujeitos nos espa\c{c}os p\'ublicos \textendash{} ingredientes considerados como favorecedores da vitalidade urbana \textendash{} o objetivo dessa pesquisa foi verificar se o desenho dessas Vilas Ol\'impicas certificadas pelo LEED-ND facilita ou dificulta essa vitalidade nos espa\c{c}os p\'ublicos, avaliando a incid\^encia de indicadores morfol\'ogicos em m\'ultiplas escalas espaciais. Primeiramente analisou-se a rela\c{c}\~ao entre configura\c{c}\~ao da malha vi\'aria e destinos di\'arios (bancos, farm\'acias, escolas, etc.) em Vancouver e no Rio de Janeiro a fim de entender como essas Vilas Ol\'impicas est\~ao inseridas no todo urbano em termos do uso do caminhar como um meio de locomo\c{c}\~ao. Indicadores de acessibilidade, densidade e diversidade, relacionados ao conceito de caminhabiliade, foram agregados em um raio de 800m a partir de cada segmento de rua das vizinhan\c{c}as e seu entorno imediato. Em segundo lugar, mapas de usos e integra\c{c}\~ao dos espa\c{c}os abertos foram graficamente justapostos, na tentativa de responder como o desenho de cada empreendimento integra ou segrega diferentes usos. Por fim, mapas de constitutividade de fachadas (acessos aos edif\'icios), mobili\'ario e vegeta\c{c}\~ao foram justapostos a modelos georreferenciados de visibilidade e permeabilidade espacial que indicam movimento potencial de pedestres. As diferentes inten\c{c}\~oes subjacentes aos planos das vizinhan\c{c}as est\~ao ``impressas'' na forma urbana em ambos os casos. Enquanto SFC foi constru\'ido em terras p\'ublicas para conectar a cidade \`a orla e reabilitar uma \'area industrial abandonada, o CIP foi constru\'ido em terras privadas como uma ``ilha'' verde e de lazer que pouco contribui para a vitalidade urbana do entorno, deficiente de infraestrutura e cercado por comunidades informais. Padr\~oes que representam um alto potencial de movimento em SFC surgem da sua rela\c{c}\~ao com o todo urbano, da diversidade de usos do solo e da integra\c{c}\~ao entre edif\'icios, espa\c{c}os p\'ublicos, corredores de transporte e orla. Enquanto isso, o CIP \'e segregado tanto da cidade do Rio de Janeiro como do seu entorno imediato, resultando em uma distribui\c{c}\~ao desigual de espa\c{c}os verdes e de lazer, altamente integrados \`aqueles que vivem dentro do condom\'inio e pouco integrados \`as comunidades do entorno. Os resultados levantam quest\~oes sobre a necessidade de aplicar processos de acredita\c{c}\~ao dispendiosos (como o LEED-ND) com o objetivo de avaliar conceitos amplos e subjetivos de "sustentabilidade" e "smart growth".},

  abstract = {Spatial relations among urban elements (buildings, streets, etc.) constantly affect the quality of urban spaces, creating more or less livable cities. The study of urban form has been a way of objectively quantifying such relations to understand their dynamics. Urban livability is the ability of urban spaces to fulfill the expectations of its inhabitants for wellbeing and quality of life. Measurable spatial patterns underlie the emergence of livable cities. Still, few researchers have considered if and how these patterns affect socioeconomic conditions across spatial scales. This paper explores the relationships between indicators of socioeconomic livability and cross-scale patterns of demographic and morphological densities within the Metro Vancouver (MV) region (Canada). Indicators of accessibility, social diversity, affordability, and economic vitality were quantified and compared among five population density clusters composed of 3450 census dissemination areas (DAs) in MV. Morphological indicators of intensity, centrality and diversity were aggregated at the DAs using spatial network analysis with five radii from 400 to 4800 m.~Socioeconomic indices were regressed on urban form variables to assess the importance~of the built environment on predicting livability-related qualities. Overall, indicators of the~intensity of urban form were the most significant to predict the socioeconomic metrics. ~ Policy relevance Policies that aim to solve urban issues should consider nonlinear relations among variables. In the case of MV, indicators of accessibility, social diversity and economic vitality are directly correlated with each other and inversely correlated with affordability.~Medium to high-density zones presented a fair equilibrium among the different livability qualities analyzed. Attributes aggregated with the 4800 m radius were highly important to predict the livability qualities within a 400 m radius, which potentially means that urban interventions may affect the livability of spaces not immediately close to them. A higher density of buildings with moderate height distributed among parcels with distinct sizes can potentially have a positive impact on economic vitality and housing affordability. The intensity and diversity of the tree canopy was important to predict active accessibility and social diversity. The inclusion of spatial diversity and network centrality measures on urban planning and design practices potentially foster more livable densification processes.},

  abstract = {A wide range of data collected by monitoring systems and by mathematical and physical modelling can be managed in the frame of spatial models developed in the GIS. In addition to data management and standard environmental analysis of air pollution, data from remote sensing (aerial and satellite images) can extend all the data sets. In spite of that simulation of air pollutant distribution is carried out by standalone computer systems, the spatial database in the frame of the GIS is used to support decision-making processes in a more efficient way. Mostly, data are included in the map layers as attributes. Other map layers are carried out by the methods of spatial interpolation, raster algebra and case oriented analysis. A series of extensions is built in the GIS to adapt its functionality. As examples, the spatial models of the flat urban area and the street canyon with extensive traffic polluted with NOx are constructed. Different scales of the spatial models require variant methods of construction, data management and spatial data sources. The measurement of NOx and O3 by the automatic monitoring system and data from the differential absorption LIDAR are used for investigation of air pollution. Spatial data contain digital maps of both the areas complemented by digital elevation models. Environmental analyses represent spatial interpolations of air pollution that are displayed in horizontal and vertical plains. Case oriented analyses are mostly focused on risk assessment methods. Finally, the LIDAR monitoring results and the results obtained by modelling and spatial analyses are discussed in the context of environmental management of the urban areas. The spatial models and their extensions are developed in the frame of the ESRI's ArcGIS and ArcView programming tools. Aerial and satellite images preprocessed by the ERDAS Imagine represent areas of Prague.},

  abstract = {Debates within the sustainable development agenda increasingly highlight the principle of intra-generational equity in promoting social sustainability. This research draws upon this principle to explore the role of urban forms in promoting social equity in access to local services. In the context of urban form and social sustainability, there has been relatively little research on the social dimension whilst precise meanings and agreement of what social equity is, in terms of how this may relate to urban forms, is unclear. However, whilst some claims support the view that mixed-use, high density compact urban forms provide better access to services and facilities, empirical evidence is lacking. A key objective of this research aims to test these claims by examining the relationship between different types of urban forms and service access issues. Through exploring the frequency of use of local services, the research uses this as an empirical method to confirm whether urban form factors or other factors, such as the role of individual choice and values, which can act to modify this relationship, influence equity in access. Geographical accessibility as well as local neighbourhood aspects is also examined. The research adopts a multi-methods approach, including secondary analysis of survey data and primary fieldwork involving case studies at the neighbourhood level. Findings reveal that aspects of urban form influence frequency of use, although other explanatory factors such as local social conditions, urban design factors, and individual choice can also have a large influence. Thus the role of urban forms in promoting social equity in access is not as simple as is sometimes portrayed, and depends a good deal on the social context.},

  abstract = {Fostering resilience in the face of environmental, socioeconomic, and political uncertainty and risk has captured the attention of academics and decision makers across disciplines, sectors, and scales. Resilience has become an important goal for cities, particularly in the face of climate change. Urban areas house the majority of the world's population, and, in addition to functioning as nodes of resource consumption and as sites for innovation, have become laboratories for resilience, both in theory and in practice. This paper reviews the scholarly literature on urban resilience and concludes that the term has not been well defined. Existing definitions are inconsistent and underdeveloped with respect to incorporation of crucial concepts found in both resilience theory and urban theory. Based on this literature review, and aided by bibliometric analysis, the paper identifies six conceptual tensions fundamental to urban resilience: (1) definition of 'urban'; (2) understanding of system equilibrium; (3) positive vs. neutral (or negative) conceptualizations of resilience; (4) mechanisms for system change; (5) adaptation versus general adaptability; and (6) timescale of action. To advance this burgeoning field, more conceptual clarity is needed. This paper, therefore, proposes a new definition of urban resilience. This definition takes explicit positions on these tensions, but remains inclusive and flexible enough to enable uptake by, and collaboration among, varying disciplines.

The ``generative'' design method of A New Theory focused less upon the specification of a final form through schematic planning, and more on the stepwise process by which a form might emerge from the evolutionary actions of a group of collaborators. In so doing, it challenged the notion of ``design'' as a progressive expression of schematic intentions, and argued for a conception of design as a stepwise, non-linear evolution in response to a series of contextual urban factors. In the 20 years since, significant progress has been made to develop the insights of generativity in urban design, as in other fields. Some of Alexander's ideas have been incorporated \textendash{} notably by practitioners of The New Urbanism \textendash{} and some have been challenged and dismissed, including, notably, by Alexander himself.

There is a renewed interest in public space with a growing belief that while modern societies no longer depend on the town square or the piazza for basic needs, good public space is required for the social and psychological health of modern communities. New public spaces are emerging around the world and old public space typologies are being retrofitted to contemporary needs. Good public space is responsive, democratic and meaningful. However, few comprehensive instruments exist to measure the quality of public space. Based on an extensive review of literature and empirical work, this paper creates a public space index to assess the quality of public space by empirically evaluating its inclusiveness, meaningfulness, safety, comfort and pleasurability. Four public spaces in downtown Tampa, Florida, are examined using the index and several applications for public space planners, designers and managers are suggested.},

  abstract = {At least 20 percent of the city of Vancouver's rental housing consists of unauthorized secondary suites -- apartments built without permits inside detached houses. Local authorities have largely come to tolerate the existence of such units, seeing them as a vital means of dealing with the city's long-standing housing affordability problems. But despite the significance of this now-common local phenomenon, there is a tendency in the media, government documents and the popular imagination to view it from a singular perspective that reduces it to a strictly law-and-markets issue. Given Vancouver's highly competitive housing market, this restricted approach to thinking about the proliferation and lenient regulation of secondary suites is in many ways justifiable, but it has also served to erase a host of other important aspects of this local phenomenon. Examining the issue through the lens of various sub-fields in Human Geography, I seek to complicate its hegemonic understandings, and suggest that thinking about secondary suites from multiple perspectives can help us grasp many of the crucial geographical problems associated with contemporary life. I argue that even if legal or market frameworks are afforded privilege, there is more to be said about this issue, for example on the role of this so-called informal housing market in the local and global economy. The widespread notion that an insufficient supply of affordable housing is the main motivation to own or live in an unauthorized secondary suite is questioned using empirical evidence from the Census. The regulatory order to which these housing units are subject is shown to be less an effect of market forces than the historical product of a series of legal landmarks stretching from the mid-nineteenth century to today. Market forces are also shown to be a problematic explanation that obscures the role of politics and social norms in the formal and informal regulation of these apartments. In addition, I examine the politics of tenant/homeowner-landlord relations associated with this unconventional housing arrangement. Finally, I argue that secondary suites are not only an object of analysis for planning and other experts, but also a forgotten site of lay-knowledge production.},

  abstract = {Haze pollution has become one of the most important environment problems in China, raising increasing serious public health concerns. When carried out through campaign-style enforcement drives, the nation's anti-air pollution policy and its implementation require all-levels of government to take measures to improve the air quality in a certain period. In this study, Xi'an, a city in northwest China, where serious haze occurs frequently, was chosen as the research sample. Based on a social network analysis of the Anti-pollution and Anti-haze Work Scheme of Xi'an for 2014 and 2015 as well as in-depth interviews with enforcement officials, we studied the attributes of the enforcement network, including the actors' respective tasks, the network's structure, and the `centrality' of the network. Compared to 2014, the goals of the 2015 scheme were clearer and more challenging, with a larger number of specific tasks and tighter time limits. The structure of the enforcement network became flatter, with a `horizontal' management arrangement that involved fewer actors. The core actors were shifted to the more authoritative departments, reflecting the reality that the campaign-style enforcement network structure had been adjusted toward the regulatory hierarchy system and routing administration. The results reveal that the implementation gap was narrowed by clearer and more specific roles and tasks, a simplified, flatter organizational network structure, greater decentralization of authority and responsibility to local departments, and more harmonious coordination among those departments with the most powerful leading actors. This study provides managers with an insight into the external and organizational factors involved in enhancing the effectiveness of anti-air pollution policy implementation.},

Most research of any endeavor is attributed to the development of the research gap, which is a primary basis in the investigation of any problem, phenomenon or scientific question. Given this accepted tenet of engagement in research, surprising in the research fraternity, we do not train researchers on how to systematically identify research gaps as basis for the investigation. This is has continued to be a common problem with novice researchers. Unfailingly, very little theory and research has been developed on identifying research gaps as a basis for a line in inquiry. The purpose of this research is threefold. First, the proposed theoretical framework builds on the five-point theoretical model of Robinson, Saldanhea, and McKoy (2011) on research gaps. Second, this study builds on the six-point theoretical model of M\"uller-Bloch and Franz (2014) on research gaps. Lastly, the purpose of this research is to develop and propose a theoretical model that is an amalgamation of the two preceding models and re-conceptualizes the research gap concepts and their characteristics. Thus, this researcher proposes a seven-point theoretical model. This article discusses the characteristics of each research and the situation in which its application is warranted in the literature review The significance of this article is twofold. First, this research provides theoretical significance by developing a theoretical model on research gaps. Second, this research attempts to build a solid taxonomy on the different characteristics of research gaps and establish a foundation. The implication for researchers is that research gaps should be structured and characterized based on their functionality. Thus, this provides researchers with a basic framework for identifying them in the literature investigation.},

  abstract = {Cities and energy are fundamentally connected. Approximately half of the energy consumed in urban areas is used by buildings, resulting in over 35\% of the world's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Urban form (i.e. building morphology and urban structure) plays an important role in building energy; however, few studies have addressed this role in a comprehensive and quantitative way due to the complexities involved in modeling urban systems. This study provides a multi- scale examination of the relationships between urban form and building energy, using the Metro Vancouver region of British Columbia, Canada as an example. The thesis applies consistent methods of 3D and energy simulation modeling at three scales, ranging from individual buildings to urban patterns (i.e. neighbourhood-scale). Quantified impacts of urban form on building heating demand, cooling demand and local energy generation potential are presented. In total, 12 building archetypes and 14 urban patterns are modeled, ranging in density from 0.3 to 2.3 FAR (10 to 250 uph). Each pattern varies in building form, building arrangement, street configuration and mix of building activities. The results illustrate that building morphology and urban structure do influence building energy demand and local energy generation potential; however, the complexity and heterogeneity of urban form at larger scales is found to abate net impacts as ``tradeoffs'' occur between the energy-reducing and energy-increasing effects of urban form characteristics. For example, while the heating and cooling demand of individual buildings can vary significantly (30\%- 70\%) with urban horizon angle (an indicator of shading from adjacent buildings), the net impact modeled at the urban pattern scale is far less (as little as 5\%). The results suggest that urban form will be one of many tools needed to mitigate current energy consumption and GHG emission levels, and synergies between urban form, building systems and materials, and occupant behaviour should be sought. Findings from this thesis will inform the work of local governments and urban planners with interest in building energy at scales larger than individual buildings.},

Travel and land-use are a function of one another, therefore it is often hypothesized that changing urban structure can result in changes in energy consumption. A popular view suggests that there is a strong negative correlation between urban density and energy consumption. This implies that increasing density will result in a reduction in energy consumption [Cities and Automobile Dependence: An International Sourcebook, Avebury Technical, Great Britain, 1989]. Using Co-Plot, an innovative multivariate statistical technique, this research crystallizes some of the relationships between density and energy consumption in western cities. The method is applied on Newman and Kenworthy's data, leading to the conclusion that there is no direct impact of total urban density. Instead several other relationships between energy consumption and density attributes can be identified.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has achieved great success in many computer vision tasks. Partially inspired by neuroscience, CNN shares many properties with the visual system of the brain. A prominent difference is that CNN is typically a feed-forward architecture while in the visual system recurrent connections are abundant. Inspired by this fact, we propose a recurrent CNN (RCNN) for object recognition by incorporating recurrent connections into each convolutional layer. Though the input is static, the activities of RCNN units evolve over time so that the activity of each unit is modulated by the activities of its neighboring units. This property enhances the ability of the model to integrate the context information, which is important for object recognition. Like other recurrent neural networks, unfolding the RCNN through time can result in an arbitrarily deep network with a fixed number of parameters. Furthermore, the unfolded network has multiple paths, which can facilitate the learning process. The model is tested on four benchmark object recognition datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST and SVHN. With fewer trainable parameters, RCNN outperforms the state-of-the-art models on all of these datasets. Increasing the number of parameters leads to even better performance. These results demonstrate the advantage of the recurrent structure over purely feed-forward structure for object recognition.},

It is shown that when we attempt to write procedures for solution of the rather larger and more complex problems encountered in practical architectural design, we discover some quite severe limitations on our current ideas about architectural design automation. The major limitations are outlined, and progress made towards overcoming them recounted.},

  abstract = {The rapid urban growth poses a huge challenge in sustaining the quality of local environment and life characteristics in contemporary cities. There is a growing body of literature on sustainable cities, QoL, livability; yet a transparent and verifiable knowledge on its assessment at the urban scale is both limited and disparate. Very recently, the use of computational models, tools and indices has seen a sudden upsurge in QoL assessment at the city and sub-city level. This research, through an exhaustive review of scientific and policy literature postulates that despite promulgation of numerous and comprehensive indices and tools, yet these demonstrate a great deal of inconsistency and incomparability. This necessitates an investigation into what ought to be the preferred attributes/features of an ideal model, thereby demanding a systematic, transparent and objective appraisal of urban QoL assessment tools used worldwide. Addressing to the above objective, the research examines peer-reviewed papers to derive eight fundamental study criteria (type of dataset, scope or parameters, sample- coverage and unit, approach, technique, model type, interphase and application) that could typically characterizes such tool. It then reviews scientific and policy literature, open-access webpages on the internet to identify a first of its kind, exhaustive inventory of 26 urban QoL models and then critically evaluates these on the basis of the eight study criteria. The ensuing results bring to the fore a plethora of new, interesting and some inconvenient findings, most importantly that not even a single tool captures all the seven theoretical dimensions of QoL. Despite meant to evaluate quality in cities, only few tools conduct qualitative, subjective, bottom-up, GIS based simulation modeling that could effectively be put to use for more public and policy oriented applications. Lastly, the research demonstrates with credible evidence that a majority of tools/index continue to understand the city as a homogenous entity, with limited know-how on the variability of QoL at the neighbourhood level.},

  abstract = {Around the world, the global flow of capital often influences urban growth in ways that can be disadvantageous to residents. Outside investment in a city's residential real estate destabilizes the equilibrium of local housing supply and residents' ability to afford it. One of the attractors of this capital, the renewal and expansion of existing housing stock through demolition and reconstruction, often involuntarily displaces these residents. This changes behaviour in ways that are less mentally and physically healthy, more environmentally harmful, and consume more resources. However, this also creates new supply, which by responding to rising demand, helps affordability and replaces aging housing, improving resilience, accessibility, safety, resource consumption and environmental impact. This investigation asks:  1.	What would the financial cost be to mitigate or eliminate involuntary displacement while still allowing creation of new housing supply and upgrading of the built environment? 2.	How feasible, and successful, are some solutions that could enable this? 3.	What are some strategies that would maximize its feasibility and success? The neighbourhood of Metrotown, in greater Vancouver, Canada, was identified as an ideal case area in which to examine these questions. A prototypical land development project was synthesized from empirical data and used to test various valuations of displacement elimination as well as alternatives to involuntary displacement. It was found that even under favourable market conditions for redevelopment, all strategies tested for full displacement elimination are not financially feasible under typical for-profit scenarios and expectations. Some voluntary displacement scenarios are shown to be financially viable, although less socially and environmentally feasible. To allow full displacement elimination, project costs must be further reduced, revenue increased, or profit targets reduced. It is shown that eliminating 50\% of required parking reduces costs, increasing profit while encouraging sustainable behaviour and reducing material usage and embodied carbon. However, to achieve full financial feasibility, a typical for-profit project under these market, social and jurisdictional conditions must shift even more costs away from the developer to be able to afford full displacement elimination while allowing all advantages of new and additional housing construction and local upgrading to occur.},

By means of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), spatial, network, and statistical analyses were performed on a selected set of components of the urban built environment. Residential density, commercial density, mixed landuse, and street connectivity were measured to determine how the following 8 urban aspects \textemdash mixed-land use, small blocks, interesting architecture, building density (commercial and residential), residents' physical activity, the impact of density and mixed-land use\textemdash{} affect transport mode or urban mobility. To better understand the walkability patterns around these TOD neighborhoods, we applied the method to Portland, which is known for being a walkable city. As Jeff Speck claims, for a place to be walkable, it is all a question of proper balance of uses, so it is important to look for what is missing or under-represented in an urban setting, whether it is office, retail, dining, entertainment, housing, school, recreation, worship, or parking (Speck 2013). The proposed graph-analysis framework can be used by professionals to improve planning and designing decisions to make cities more attractive and sustainable. However, it is not intended to replace the existing ways of evaluating walkability, but instead, it is to be seen as an additional layer of information to be introduced at an early stage of any project.},

Usual antagonistic forms of citizens' self-organisation have been increasingly replaced by new forms of interaction between citizens and institutions. These have arisen great enthusiasm as innovative urban policies that seem to open up the possibility of recovering abandoned urban spaces, which was unthinkable in the logic of top-down or dialogic approaches. In many cases their transformative potential was taken for granted, and has not been explored the possibility that such policies become means of control and injustice, and spaces where 'citizens' are used to offset the disappearance of opportunities for urban democracy and social support through the welfare state.Assuming the program of Apulia Region "Urban Laboratories: old buildings for young ideas" as case study, our paper reflects on the ability of these interactive forms of self-organization to favour the emergence of real democratic civic re-appropriation of abandoned areas by claiming their character of 'public spaces'.AbstractNella citt\`a contemporanea, le forme di of riappropriazione da parte dei cittadini di spazi urbani degradati e abbandonati sono molto cambiate.

  abstract = {Following decades of both planned and market-driven decentralization of cities and city-regions, urban policy makers arenow extolling the virtues of thecompact city. The model which is held up as a good example is that of the traditional European city which is relatively dense and fine-grained. The model that is no longer considered sustainable (economically and socially as well as environmentally) is the sprawl, strip or edge city, more often than not planned around the automobile. One question is the extent to which this European model of the good city transfers to the UK context. The author would argue that a number of engrained attitudes to city planning (and indeed city life) persist which together might undermine attempts to stimulate more active and culturally confident cities. Nevertheless, if we are to have more active and better cities, we need to know how best to manage, develop and design them. This paper argues that the city is a phenomenon of structured complexity. Good cities tend to be a balance of a reasonably ordered and legible city form, and places of many and varied comings and goings, meetings and transactions. What might appear to some as disorder is very often simply the everyday rhythm of city life. In the absence of such activity, cities can lose their urbanity and eventually become suburban in character. The large part of this paper contains an exposition of the principles of good city form, activity, street life and urban culture. That is to say, urbanity itself. By reference to a number of cities, the intention is to show that it is perfectly possible to plan for and design the active city.},

While affordability problems increased consistently over the last two decades for almost all classes of households, the problems are highly concentrated among those with low-incomes. Women household maintainers are significantly more likely to experience problems and the number of income recipients in a household is a key indicator of a potential problem. While all regions and major cities had increasing problems, the data show major differences across regions and urban centres. No correlation is found between the growth of cities or the growth in rent levels and the growth of the proportion of low-income households with severe affordability problems. Housing prices were remarkably stable during the 1990s and cannot be claimed as the main cause of the escalating problem. However, strong correlations relate the growth of affordability problems to city size and to the prevailing rent level, suggesting that land rent is a factor in determining the problem's spatial incidence and that continued concentration of the population in major cities will continue to fuel the growth of the problem. The most disturbing finding is that, for the most vulnerable groups, the prevalence and severity of affordability problems worsened during the 1990s, reflecting the consequences of a larger and longer trend toward increasing income inequality in Canadian society. The paper points to other research which links the affordability issue to homelessness and argues that the trends in affordability burdens be considered as ripe for serious policy intervention at all three levels of government. While specific policy conclusions cannot be based on this study, the results do point to the growing need for a change in Canadian housing policy.},

 through Section 37 agreements, while Vancouver uses agreements known as

 determine the values of these agreements; what type of benefits the cities secure
 from developers; how the cities determine which type of benefits to secure; and
 who benefits from the agreements. It also compares the use of such agreements in
 the two cities to the three most common rationales invoked to justify their use:
 sharing the wealth created by development, funding related infrastructure
 upgrades, and compensating those negatively affected by the development. The
 analysis shows that the process of negotiating DBAs is inherently lacking in
 transparency and that there are valid arguments either for abolishing DBAs
 altogether, or for replacing them with alternative tools such as inclusionary
 housing provisions.},

Many observers are concerned, however, that the diffusion of systems based on renewable resources may give rise to energy sprawl, i.e. an increasing occupation of available land to build new energy facilities of this kind. These critics foresee a transition from the traditional fossil-fuel systems, towards a renewable resource system likewise based on large power stations and extensive energy grids. A different approach can be taken to reduce the risk of energy sprawl, and this will happen if the focus is as much on renewable sources as on the introduction of distributed renewable energy systems based on micro plants (photovoltaic panels on the roofs of buildings, micro wind turbines, etc.) and on multiple micro-grids. Policy makers could foster local energy enterprises by: introducing new enabling rules; making more room for contractual communities; simplifying the compliance process; proposing monetary incentives and tax cuts. We conclude that the diffusion of innovation in this field will lead not to an energy sprawl but to a new energy system characterized by a multi-layered density: a combination of technology, organization, and physical development.},

The so-called `theorypractice gap' is not the main issue at all; the real question is `which theory for what kind of practice'? Assuming this view, the article presents two different theories of public regulation: the teleocratic approach and the nomocratic approach.They can be interpreted as general approaches regarding the role of the state, but the article focus particularly on the consequences of accepting them in the specific field of land-use regulation. For the teleocratic approach, planning must be the central and most important instrument of land-use regulation, while for the nomocratic approach planning has only a secondary role and different kind of regulative instruments are proposed.},

However, some critics have argued that complex systems require exactly the opposite treatment, that is, simple rather than complex legal rules. This article explores the concept of simple rules for urban development, investigating what they are, why they are superior, and how they can be achieved.},

The error of this insistence was persuasively argued by Jane Jacobs in the 1960s. Subsequently, planning theory and practice came to recognise the importance of density, but this return to favour requires remaining constantly alert to the possible dangers and pitfalls.MethodsCritically considering the traditional and contemporary urban planning literature and the empirical evidence in the recent economic and geographical research, this article investigates the whys and wherefores of density in urban planning. It addresses two main questions: Is urban density really desirable (and why)? Is it effectively manageable (and how)?ResultsDensity per se is meaningless unless it is a tool or condition for achieving something further. And even if the instrumental function of density were to be acknowledged, it is crucial to take into account that density is not solely (or merely) a tool which\textemdash in certain conditions\textemdash can be useful in reducing commute times and minimising the encroachment on undeveloped land. Its primary advantage concerns favouring the concentrated diverse admix of human preferences, tastes, abilities, know-how, uses, activities, and so forth.ConclusionsAfter having expressly laboured to avoid it for so long, the aim is not to create density directly, but to open the door and allow density to happen in our cities, thanks to more abstract and general planning rules.},

Over the last two decades, the success of S106, which seeks to extract some of the development value created by planning consent, has been predicated on rising land values and market demand, thus enabling developers to agree and fulfill their planning obligations. The purpose of this article is to explore how negotiations between local authorities and developers with regard to meeting S106 have altered during the economic downturn in England. Drawing on recent empirical research, and through the use of case studies, the article highlights the ways in which S106 agreements have been renegotiated at the site level, with the discretionary nature of the planning system allowing compromises to be made. Despite S106 being tied to market activity, with developer contributions being reduced in a downturn, it remains an important policy tool in securing affordable housing and achieving inclusionary housing goals within England to date.},

  title = {Does the {{Community Amenity Charge Rachet Skew}} Our {{Housing Market}}? | {{LinkedIn}}},
  author = {Mortensen, Michael},
  year = {2020},
  abstract = {When cities set "Community Amenity Contributions" based on zenith sales price assumptions, are they unintentionally skewing their housing markets to luxury submarkets over more domestic ones? I think this has been the case in Vancouver and Metro Vancouver. Many cities charge developers for new developable area when they rezone properties. In effect, Cities are clawing back the land lift associated with new development rights and intensities granted through rezonings. The practice in the City of Vancouver (and increasingly other municipalities) is that the City seeks to extract 75\% of the land lift, leaving a bit on the table to cover the developer's expenses to assemble and rezone etc. Many land economists argue that negotiated Community Amenity Contributions do not impact housing end-prices. They assert that the land lift extracted by Cities as CAC's ``come out of land prices''. However, the reality (and problem) is that most CAC's are negotiated by Cities long after developers buy land, and often at the very end of the rezoning process. One has to guess what the CAC is going to be at the time of the land purchase; there are no opportunities to go back and renegotiate your original purchase price if the City gives you a CAC surprise. The CAC process is not transparent or predictable and the actual CAC demanded by Cities - predicated on current zenith housing sale prices - can be significantly higher than the developer's going-in assumption. Note that power in these negotiations is very asymmetrical: Council has absolute power to approve or reject rezoning applications. Many developers recover from `CAC surprises' by swallowing the additional cost and reorienting their product to higher-end segments of the market, increasing sales prices and setting in the process NEW zenith sale prices which in turn rachet up City's CAC expectations for rezoning applications that follow. That's the "Rachet" pictured above. This economic machinery works generally in a rising market if one ignores the increasing unaffordability of new product for local incomes and local buyers. However, the cracks in the business model appear when the market is moving in opposite direction. A recent article in the Globe and Mail highlight's Vancouver's over-reliance on Community Amenity Contributions to fund core City Amenities. See: ttps://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-flow-of-money-from-builders-for-community-amenities-in-vancouver-dries/ Many projects are stalled because the CACs demanded by local government - predicated on old zenith sales prices - are not supportable when markets weaken. To be clear, I agree with the principle that new land use intensities should be accompanied with commensurate increases in local amenities funded by development. And while a City-Wide review of land use is well overdue to reset development options under existing land use zoning (and avoid lengthy rezonings), I believe that Vancouver's transactional and discretionary land use and rezoning system has worked and can continue to work for us, delivering an array of new housing, shops, amenities and good urban design and placemaking. I am questioning the practice where zenith sales prices are used to set CACs because these have eclipsed the capacity of local incomes. CACs should be reasonable and should not impair economic development options and they should not be set so high that one cannot sell new homes at prices that are supportable based on local incomes. Generally speaking, new development ALREADY pays its fair share towards the cost of servicing new growth even before the extraction of CACs. Consider City DCL's at \$28/sf Gross Floor Area; City Engineering Charges for Off-Site upgrades (sometimes six-figures); Metro DCCs at \$1072/apt; Translink DCCs at \$1545/unit; Public Art at \$2/sf GFA etc). Note that CAC's are pretty much off the table for rental housing because the end rents needed to support such increased land values are so far off the charts that even local governments admit, grudgingly, that any CAC of any kind is not supportable. The numbers don't lie. Is there some hope that we can have a rational approach on the CAC issue? Can we have more reasonable CAC demands and a more transparent CAC process? One very interesting recent land negotiation has set an interesting precedent but it has not received a lot of attention: the South False Creek Land Lease renewals. Few people have taken notice that the basis for the City's lease renewal valuation was set based on the shelter payments predicated on local incomes vs the zenith of the absolute ``highest and best use''. This got me wondering: "What if CACs were more transparent across the City and Region, and what if they were set based on projected sales prices and land residuals informed by what people living and working in Vancouver can afford?"

With this, we seek to contribute to the debate on how the role of the local state has changed from securing affordable housing for low-income households into becoming an essential player involved in real estate speculation. Taking Little Mountain in Vancouver as the first example, we examine the privatization and demolition of the public housing complex and thus the withdrawal of the state. Our second example, Ostend in Frankfurt, investigates the restructuring of a working-class neighbourhood through active state-led interventions including massive public investment. We analyse the two empirical examples along five dimensions: causal drivers and mechanisms that have led to the changing role of the state in governing urban transformations; policy instruments used by state agencies to encourage gentrification; strategies to legitimize state-led gentrification; outcomes in terms of direct and exclusionary displacement; and the forms of contestation and protest. We maintain that both cases, although presenting a stark contrast, follow the same rule, namely state-led gentrification.},

To address these issues, urban planners follow integrated planning approaches that are more compatible with sustainable development objectives. Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) is widely recognized as one of the most feasible and comprehensive sustainable planning approaches. In this research, a three-step TOD-based method was developed for sustainable urban planning in the central region of Tehran. First, a measurable index was developed to assess public transit infrastructure (PTI) and TOD levels in the study area. At the second step, which was the focus of the research, an Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) approach was used to make a balance between TOD and PTI levels. ABM is a bottom-up approach that can solve spatial problems and can be integrated with top-down policies and spatial analysis tools. Finally, the performance of the model was evaluated by conducting several statistical, visual and empirical assessments using Tehran municipality's reference data. These assessments confirmed the efficiency and feasibility of the model.},

Yet, this research is limited by the lack of methods that can be used to quantify the appearance of streetscapes across cities or at high enough spatial resolutions. In this paper, we describe `Streetscore', a scene understanding algorithm that predicts the perceived safety of a streetscape, using training data from an online survey with contributions from more than 7000 participants. We first study the predictive power of commonly used image features using support vector regression, finding that Geometric Texton and Color Histograms along with GIST are the best performers when it comes to predict the perceived safety of a streetscape. Using Streetscore, we create high resolution maps of perceived safety for 21 cities in the Northeast and Midwest of the United States at a resolution of 200 images/square mile, scoring {$\sim$}1 million images from Google Streetview. These datasets should be useful for urban planners, economists and social scientists looking to explain the social and economic consequences of urban perception.},

Previous investigations have concentrated either on complexity or on diversity, but not both. This volume makes clear the relation between complexity and diversity with examples drawn from various disciplines. Compiles here are presentations from the Complexity and Diversity workshop held in Fugue, Japan, in August 1996. The contributions are the results of research in mathematical systems, physical systems, living systems, and social systems, and are contained in the four corresponding sections of the book.

And as an economic parameter that can be valued under specific price mechanisms of urban properties. The paper shows a first preliminary study of testing street prices with spatial accessibility measures. The method was to use current house prices with Space Syntax techniques, a spatial analysis tool that outputs measures of connectivity and accessibility represented in a street network. Overall, economy contributes on the shape of our cities that prevail in the spatial relations of the built form, resulting in new configurational economies.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the role of spatial parameters in relation to economic properties embedded in the city's urban form. The key element to explore in the study of the configuration of space is accessibility. The role of markets has always been a factor of constant transformation that influence how a city develops and functions at different scales. Markets function as institutions in which price it the main indicator of people's choices and the spatial effects that these choices generate, that is, a signal of how people assign a value to different resources. Accessibility, in this case, is seen here not only as a spatial component to measure geometric patterns but also as a resource that produces multiplied values of benefits and transactions in terms of economic properties. It is proposed to explore three economic variables applied in the city of Cardiff, Wales. These variables are council tax band, sold house prices and average price for each housing typology. The method used to test each of these variables is by using Space Syntax analysis with the purpose to unfold the measure of accessibility within specific markets, which in this case it is only considered residential properties. Council tax band is measured only with a sample of two postcode districts of Cardiff related to integration measures, which show differences in relation to local accessibility and size of urban blocks. Sold house prices are studied within a period of 3 years proving that there is a clear relation of tax banding and the price paid of properties. Overall, the paper aims to explore, as a first stage of the research, how specific measures of economic variables have an effect on how space is formed through these kinds of processes, in which the size of a city, its particular morphology and its allocation of land uses are aspects that rule a city's economic vitality and constant reform.},

  abstract = {Urban transportation networks, from sidewalks and bicycle paths to streets and rail lines, provide the backbone for movement and socioeconomic life in cities. These networks can be understood as layers of a larger multiplex transport network. Because most cities are car-centric, the most developed layer is typically the street layer, while other layers can be highly disconnected. To make urban transport sustainable, cities are increasingly investing to develop their bicycle networks. However, given the usually patchy nature of the bicycle network layer, it is yet unclear how to extend it comprehensively and effectively given a limited budget. Here we develop data-driven, algorithmic network growth strategies and apply them to cities around the world, showing that small but focused investments allow to significantly increase the connectedness and directness of urban bicycle networks. We motivate the development of our algorithms with a network component analysis and with multimodal urban fingerprints that reveal different classes of cities depending on the connectedness between different network layers. We introduce two greedy algorithms to add the most critical missing links in the bicycle layer: The first algorithm connects the two largest connected components, the second algorithm connects the largest with the closest component. We show that these algorithms outmatch both a random approach and a baseline minimum investment strategy that connects the closest components ignoring size. Our computational approach outlines novel pathways from car-centric towards sustainable cities by taking advantage of urban data available on a city-wide scale. It is a first step towards a quantitative consolidation of bicycle infrastructure development that can become valuable for urban planners and stakeholders.},

  abstract = {The pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) has led to several concerns on male fertility. Nowadays, there are numerous unanswered questions, for example: is the virus present or not in the seminal fluid of infected subjects? Could the seminal fluid represent a way of sexual transmission for the virus? Why do men appear to be more susceptible than women? Several studies have been carried out to ascertain the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the seminal fluid, with contrasting results; the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the testes and in the male genital tract led to speculation about the possible presence of the virus in the seminal fluid. However, it was found that ACE2 and TMPRSS2, used by the virus to enter host cells, are expressed differently in certain testicle cells (stem germ cells, Leydig and Sertoli cells), yet the testicle cells in which ACE2 and TMPRSS2 molecules are simultaneously expressed are rare. This fact would suggest that the virus is not able to enter testicular cells, that it is not present in the seminal fluid and that it cannot infect male germ cells. However, the direct influence of SARS-CoV-2 on the testes is still to be evaluated, and recent results are very controversial. SARS-CoV-2 could enter the testicle using alternative paths and lead to alterations in testicular functionality. Another plausible consideration is that the COVID-19 disease could also indirectly cause alterations to testicular activity; since the fever and the cytokinic storm generated by the immune system can lead to damage of the testicular activity, consequently compromising male fertility.},

However, a living system is also a dynamical system, which means that the emergence of identity and the unity of the system is inseparable from the generation of its degrees of freedom. These degrees of freedom have different levels of complexity, given by the multidimensional patterns instantiating them, offering various alternatives to respond to environmental perturbation. From the point of view of the multidimensionality of degrees of freedom of a living system, which depends on the degree of self-organization and complexity of the organism, one can distinguish three types of autonomy: minimal or basic autonomy, sensorimotor autonomy, and strong autonomy. Put in these terms, autonomy depends on the abilities of the organism to access some degrees of freedom of higher complexity, to enhance its degrees of freedom by its coupling with the environment, as a result of its bodily skills, and to consciously control and monitorize its degrees of freedom, as a result of its higher-order cognitive abilities.},

  abstract = {Urban vegetation, and in particular urban forests, provide a wide range of ecosystem services to urban societies and may thus be classified as environmental goods. Their status as goods suggests that urban societies' interactions with urban vegetation should be subjected to equity analyses to determine the fairness of such interactions. However, despite good evidence that the distribution and governance of urban vegetation are inequitable in many cases, there is no urban forestry-specific framework for analysis of urban green equity: how we access and govern urban vegetation. To begin to fill this gap, this paper reviews research in the fields of ethics, social and environmental justice, political ecology, and urban forestry research and practice, with a focus on urban forestry, and presents a discussion of the dimensions and sub-dimensions of urban green equity. The principal dimensions that emerged from the analysis were (1) the spatial distribution of urban vegetation, and (2) recognition in urban vegetation decision making, defined here as acknowledgement of participants' difference, existence and validity in decision-making processes, both formal and informal, and the inherent inclusion and power associated with that acknowledgement. Sub-dimensions of spatial distribution included temporality, condition, preference, and ownership, and sub-dimensions of recognition included representation and procedure, and the desire and ability to participate in decision making processes. These dimensions provide a framework for future urban green equity analyses and can help inform public conversations on urban green equity.},

  abstract = {This research examines the distributional equity of urban vegetation in 10 US urbanized areas using very high resolution land cover data and census data. Urban vegetation is characterized three ways in the analysis (mixed vegetation, woody vegetation, and public parks), to reflect the variable ecosystem services provided by different types of urban vegetation. Data are analyzed at the block group and census tract levels using Spearman's correlations and spatial autoregressive models. There is a strong positive correlation between urban vegetation and higher education and income across most cities. Negative correlations between racialized minority status and urban vegetation are observed but are weaker and less common in multivariate analyses that include additional variables such as education, income, and population density. Park area is more equitably distributed than mixed and woody vegetation, although inequities exist across all cities and vegetation types. The study finds that education and income are most strongly associated with urban vegetation distribution but that various other factors contribute to patterns of urban vegetation distribution, with specific patterns of inequity varying by local context. These results highlight the importance of different urban vegetation measures and suggest potential solutions to the problem of urban green inequity. Cities can use our results to inform decision making focused on improving environmental justice in urban settings.},

The idea that urban form embodies idiosyncrasies related to cultural identities captures the imagination of many in urban studies, but it is an assumption yet to be carefully examined. Approaching spatial configurations in the built environment as a proxy of urban culture, this paper searches for differences potentially consistent with specific regional cultures or cultures of planning in urban development. It does so focusing on the elementary components shaping cities: buildings and how they are aggregated in cellular complexes of built form. Exploring Shannon's work, we introduce an entropy measure to analyse the probability distribution of cellular arrangements in built form systems. We apply it to downtown areas of 45 cities from different regions of the world as a similarity measure to compare and cluster cities potentially consistent with specific spatial cultures. Findings suggest a classification scheme that sheds further light on what we call the "cultural hypothesis": the possibility that different cultures and regions find different ways of ordering space.},

We then run a Oaxaca-Blinder style decomposition analysis to explain the race gap in household formation over this 13-year period, and conduct several robustness checks. We find strong support for the influence of economic context, with strikingly different results by race. Blacks were most sensitive to rents, which increased more dramatically for black young adults over most of the 2001-2013 period compared with whites' rents. The results also suggest that blacks were operating in strongly segmented housing markets throughout this period. In contrast, whites were most sensitive to employment rates, which decreased for white young adults over this period from 75 percent in 2001 to 70 percent in 2013. Despite their unrestricted access to the entire labor market, falling employment proved a significant deterrent to new household formation for white young adults.},

  abstract = {This paper analyzes the relationship between livability and structure of two towns in Sumida city, Tokyo. Being historically and spatially contrasted despite located nearby, Kyojima and Honjo are comparatively analyzed under two different methods. According to a well-established topological analysis of city by Hillier (1998), Space Syntax{${'}$}s Axial Map is applied to evaluate {${'}$}syntactic intelligibility{${'}$} and the degree of {${'}$}natural movement{${'}$} at both towns. Based upon {${'}$}Graph Geometry{${'}$} proposed by Nophaket (2004 a), the towns{${'}$} minimum-path structures are also detected. The network analysis applies Dijkstra algorithm to visualize the {${'}$}Network Pattern{${'}$} of street structure via C-language computer simulation (Nophaket, 2004 b). Comparison between topological-syntactic structure and geometrical-network pattern testifies not only significant contrasts in street patterns of Kyojima and Honjo, but also the different logic between two analytical models.Whilst Axial Map specifically shows the quantitative correlation between {${'}$}integration value{${'}$} and pedestrian or vehicle flow rate on each straight line, the new Path Map of Network Pattern detects an overall {${'}$}qualitative pattern{${'}$}, the organic grid of winding streets in particular. Importantly, it shows the vital linkage of city. This study can conclude that Space Syntax model based on depth analysis implies a macro structure of city. Network Pattern, by contrast, represents the metrical significance of street at a more detailed level.The research findings, therefore, challenge an accepted generalization of applying Space Syntax across different cultures, archetypes and scales of street patterns. Moreover, it includes the geometrical analysis into basic graph-network study of urban form. As we believe, it is this metrical importance of street pattern that has been lost, perhaps not fully justifiably, within traditional Space Syntax analysis of the city.},

Cultured endothelial and neuronal cells were incubated with and wild type mice were injected IV with different spike subunits. In situ analyses were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 proteins and the host response. In 13/13 brains from fatal COVID-19, pseudovirions (spike, envelope, and membrane proteins without viral RNA) were present in the endothelia of microvessels ranging from 0 to 14 positive cells/200\texttimes{} field (mean 4.3). The pseudovirions strongly co-localized with caspase-3, ACE2, IL6, TNF{$\alpha$}, and C5b-9. The surrounding neurons demonstrated increased NMDAR2 and neuronal NOS plus decreased MFSD2a and SHIP1 proteins. Tail vein injection of the full length S1 spike subunit in mice led to neurologic signs (increased thirst, stressed behavior) not evident in those injected with the S2 subunit. The S1 subunit localized to the endothelia of microvessels in the mice brain and showed co-localization with caspase-3, ACE2, IL6, TNF{$\alpha$}, and C5b-9. The surrounding neurons showed increased neuronal NOS and decreased MFSD2a. It is concluded that ACE2+ endothelial damage is a central part of SARS-CoV2 pathology and may be induced by the spike protein alone. Thus, the diagnostic pathologist can use either hematoxylin and eosin stain or immunohistochemistry for caspase 3 and ACE2 to document the endothelial cell damage of COVID-19.},

This territoriality thesis is examined in 3 studies of the 311 system in Boston, Massachusetts, focusing on whether reporting and the motivations for it are centered around the home. Study 1 demonstrated that the vast majority of those using 311's traditional channels (i.e., hotline and Internet) reported issues exclusively within a narrow range around their homes. Study 2 found that a smart phone application, which presumably increases mobility, expanded this range, but only into other spaces in the neighborhood. In Study 3, a field experiment found that advertisements for the 311 system that prime territoriality by referencing the local neighborhood were more effective in encouraging reporting than those referencing the broader city. Implications for extending research and policy on territoriality and maintenance of the urban commons and for coproduction policies, more generally, are discussed.

  abstract = {Research on collective efficacy in urban neighborhoods has focused predominantly on whether a community can regulate local behavior and spaces and less on how they do so. This study pursues the latter question by examining the social regularities that create collective efficacy, measured as the behavioral composition of a neighborhood (i.e., the extent to which each individual contributes to a social regularity). This perspective is applied to the database of requests for non-emergency government services received by Boston, MA's 311 system in 2011 (\textbackslash textgreater160,000 requests). The analysis categorized custodians who have used the system to combat physical disorder in the public space (e.g., requesting graffiti removal) into two groups-"typical custodians" who have made one or two requests in a year, and "exemplars" who have made three or more. A neighborhood's collective efficacy in reporting public issues was identified through audits of sidewalk quality and streetlight outages. Analyses revealed a collaborative model of maintenance in which typical and exemplar custodians were each necessary and non-substitutable. A second analysis found that the two types of custodian were associated with different contextual factors, articulating two different pathways from demographic and social characteristics to collective efficacy, suggesting implications for theory and practice.

The regularization of the Voronoi medial axis (VMA) in the sense of Blum's prairie re analogy is done by attributing each component of the VMA with a measure of prominence and stability. The resulting Voronoi skeletons (VSK) appear largely invariant with respect to typical noise conditions in the image and geometric transformations. Hierarchical clustering of the skeleton branches, the so-called skeleton pyramid, leads to further simpli cation of the skeleton. Several applications demonstrate the suitability of the Voronoi skeleton to higher order tasks such as object recognition.},

For landscapes to be ecologically sustainable, the landscape structure should support those ecological processes required for the landscape to deliver biodiversity services for present and future generations. We first show that in multifunctional, human-dominated landscapes, biodiversity conservation needs a coherent large-scale spatial structure of ecosystems. Theory and empirical knowledge of ecological networks provides a framework for the design of such structures. Secondly, ecological networks can bridge the paradox between reserve conservation (fixing nature in space and time) and development, which implies change. This is because ecological networks can change structure without losing their conservation potential. Thirdly, ecological networks facilitate stakeholder decision-making on feasible biodiversity goals. They help to focus on an effective spatial scale. We conclude that extending the ecological network concept with multifunctional indicators is a promising step towards sustainable landscape development and stakeholder decision-making.},

Tehran, which is viewed as the capital and vital city of Iran, has experienced this issue for a long time, and there are no legitimate arrangement found to decrease its air contamination. Then again, the city has movement from different parts of the nation consistently that makes this issue harsher. The most vital issue in such manner is the city's range, and in addition the city's extension, which decides the thickness of the city. The greater part of this must be joined by the wear and tear of a low standard, which includes a high level of contamination. The failure of the vast majority to purchase houses inside the city has made satellite towns nearby Tehran. Then again, the presence of tremendous local locations around Tehran and the area of workplaces in the downtown area are among alternate issues tended to in this investigation.

Following the growing interest in network geography in understanding urban dynamics, rather than measuring centrality (accessibility) by a priori knowledge of central business district (CBD) locations, in this article we measure the centrality of each link in a city's street network, modelled as a topological graph. We use this to understand clustering behaviour of firms by industrial classification in the city of Ankara, Turkey. Our underlying hypothesis rests on the assumption that the geometry and topology of an urban grid contains accessibility information about the distribution of agglomeration economies and diseconomies, and that different types of enterprises are sensitive to this distribution in various ways. Among other things, the results of the study allow us to predict the evolution of what we call candidate centres (locations that could, by virtue of their connectivity footprint, become subcentres), actual subcentres and CBD functions in response to changes in a city's street network. Decoding how commercial cluster locations interact with the detailed pattern of street-network-based centralities will be helpful for urban planning policy, in particular for commercial zoning decisions such as expanding CBDs and identifying locations for new subcentres that have an acceptable chance of success.},

The aim of this study is to employ actual transaction data and machine learning models to predict prices of real estate. The actual transaction data contain attributes and transaction prices of real estate that respectively serve as independent variables and dependent variables for machine learning models. The study employed four machine learning models-namely, least squares support vector regression (LSSVR), classification and regression tree (CART), general regression neural networks (GRNN), and backpropagation neural networks (BPNN), to forecast real estate prices. In addition, genetic algorithms were used to select parameters of machine learning models. Numerical results indicated that the least squares support vector regression outperforms the other three machine learning models in terms of forecasting accuracy. Furthermore, forecasting results generated by the least squares support vector regression are superior to previous related studies of real estate price prediction in terms of the average absolute percentage error. Thus, the machine learning-based model is a substantial and feasible way to forecast real estate prices, and the least squares support vector regression can provide relatively competitive and satisfactory results.},

For evaluation, a randomly selected sample of 628 inhabitants from 35 residential areas were asked to express their opinion on importance of each `livability attributes', preferred by professionals as being important for contributing towards livability. The perspectives of inhabitant's and professionals were then compared. The analysis confirms the difference in livability perception of inhabitants' and the livability provided in residential areas by professionals'. Further investigation is therefore required to identify appropriate livability attributes as per desired livability of inhabitants' in Indian context for inclusion in planning and design process.},

The language PLASM will support a small set of abstract data types which are significant in various outstanding problems of architectural design, and will offer both procedural features and non-procedural constraints satisfaction. It will allow the designer to make use of a large set of computing tools in any phase of architectural design, in order to explore a wider set of design solutions. Customizable evaluation functions will be available in the language. The execution of a PLASM program may result either in generating or in updating a semantic network over a set of data objects solving the geometric problem under consideration. The proposed language will support both abstract data types significant in the design domain, and tools performing automatized data generation and transformations between different data types. The modification of any object in such a system, both performed by editing a daemon program and/or by interactively modifying a data object, will result in the immediate propagation of changes into the problem network, by activating a message passing mechanism.},

  abstract = {This article is concerned with masterplan implementation and with exploring, via recourse to case studies, slippages between masterplanning principles, policies, and practices. Framed by a growing body of sustainable urbanism literature we analyse evidence from five masterplanned communities in the UK and Australia to comparatively explore how some key theoretical principles are translated into placemaking in inner urban, suburban, outer urban and semi-rural contexts. We observe varying degrees of disjuncture between masterplanning principles and the urban form envisioned by, and realized through, actual masterplanning proposals and implementation. We postulate that various degrees of slippage at each stage from proposals to practices have occurred which can affect capacity to meet principles of sustainable urbanism. Analysis of the five cases demonstrates where some potential ``tripping-up'' points lie in the masterplanning process, hinting at broader impediments to delivering masterplanning that is more closely aligned to sustainable urbanism principles in future.},

The urban planning system is limited in recognizing it, but planners adapt to these autonomous processes by deviating from the plan. The result is a dual system of rules and systematic exceptions, which lacks the ability to steer and evaluate the overall direction of urban progress. Similar yet explicit dual problem-solving procedures of statutory rule frameworks and adaptations applying previous cases are common in many fields. Applying this multi-disciplinary knowledge, I propose a dual, computation-supported planning procedure combining rule-based and case-based reasoning. Such planning could respond to urban self-organization, while guiding urban dynamics in a consistent manner. The operation of this coupled system is illustrated using the empirical example of Lielahti, a mixed-use working place district in the Finnish city of Tampere in an exploratory manner.},

By analogy with auto-encoders, we propose Context Encoders -- a convolutional neural network trained to generate the contents of an arbitrary image region conditioned on its surroundings. In order to succeed at this task, context encoders need to both understand the content of the entire image, as well as produce a plausible hypothesis for the missing part(s). When training context encoders, we have experimented with both a standard pixel-wise reconstruction loss, as well as a reconstruction plus an adversarial loss. The latter produces much sharper results because it can better handle multiple modes in the output. We found that a context encoder learns a representation that captures not just appearance but also the semantics of visual structures. We quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of our learned features for CNN pre-training on classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. Furthermore, context encoders can be used for semantic inpainting tasks, either stand-alone or as initialization for non-parametric methods.},

  year = {2019},
  abstract = {The complexity of cities presents a key challenge in being able to `decode` and subsequently measure or describe them. Adding to these challenges is the transdisciplinary nature of city design which largely accords to disciplinary silos. This research argues that successful city design can benefit from understanding cities as complex sociotechnical systems \textendash{} considering the interaction between humans, technology and the environment. This paper provides a precis of a programme of research which utilised the results of an international survey to `decode' and construct a systems model of a main street to help understand and appropriately respond to city complexity. The research uses subject matter expert knowledge and insights from 70 survey participants, across 5 continents, to model an archetype main street. The project describes and models hundreds of physical objects, priority measures and main street functions with linkages between these components. The model allows for the exploration and measurement of a range of both technical characteristics such as engineering standards, as well as the influence and outcomes of necessary subjective measures like, user experience. It was able to provide an insight about which characteristics are critical to the city system, how they are delivered and why they are important - from a transdisciplinary perspective. This paper also highlights the work done to identify the relationships between the physical objects of a main street. Further details of the research programme are highlighted in the conclusions, including how the archetype model was used to explore the performance of a main street case study, identify missing components and locate them with consideration of their optimal proximity to other related features. We argue that this innovative approach may provide a more structured and process driven exploration of city design.},

The Pedestrian Environment Index (PEI) is defined as the product of four components representing land-use diversity (based on the concept of entropy), population density, commercial density, and intersection density. The final PEI is bound between 0 and 1, and uses data that typically are readily available to planners and metropolitan planning organizations (MPO). The results of this method are region-specific; they are comparable only between the zones within the given study area. As a case study, the city of Chicago is analyzed at the sub-traffic analysis zone (sub-TAZ) level. The results agree closely with the expectation of pedestrian friendliness across different parts of the city. Possible extensions are also listed, including a further study to determine statistical relationships between the PEI and common socio-economic characteristics. The method could also be further improved should more types of data become available.},

We show that the heuristic is capable of delivering results which are indistinguishable from the more exact and numerically expensive MCMC method in many artificial and empirical networks, despite being much faster. The method is entirely unbiased towards any specific mixing pattern, and in particular it does not favor assortative community structures.},

Then by using philosophy of new materialism, new technologies such as machine learning and new data represented by multi-source urban data those having emerged in recent years in order to clarify the possibility of new technologies for urban analysis and design simulation. In particular, convolution neural network has been used to make a large-scale and fine discriminant on the style of urban texture and land use classification. Finally, based on discussions, the paper further clarifies the main direction of current research, which is the possibility of artificial intelligence intervening in urban complex systems and new technologies for urban analysis, designs and simulations. The authors believe that these explorations not only provide more accurate and intuitive analysis in research methods, but also provide the possibility to innovate existing design thoughts and methods by applying artificial intelligence technology to serve urban design research.},

We also illustrate how this complexity-based modeling framework can be implemented; i.e., how it can be used to select modeling techniques that address particular properties of complex systems that we need to understand in order to model transitions to sustainability. In doing so, we establish a complexity-based approach towards modeling sustainability transitions that caters for the broad range of complex systems' properties that are required to model transitions to sustainability.},

  abstract = {Catastrophic events share characteristic nonlinear behaviors that are often generated by cross-scale interactions and feedbacks among system elements. These events result in surprises that cannot easily be predicted based on information obtained at a single scale. Progress on catastrophic events has focused on one of the following two areas: nonlinear dynamics through time without an explicit consideration of spatial connectivity [Holling, C. S. (1992) Ecol. Monogr. 62, 447\textendash 502] or spatial connectivity and the spread of contagious processes without a consideration of cross-scale interactions and feedbacks [Zeng, N., Neeling, J. D., Lau, L. M. \& Tucker, C. J. (1999) Science 286, 1537\textendash 1540]. These approaches rarely have ventured beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries. We provide an interdisciplinary, conceptual, and general mathematical framework for understanding and forecasting nonlinear dynamics through time and across space. We illustrate the generality and usefulness of our approach by using new data and recasting published data from ecology (wildfires and desertification), epidemiology (infectious diseases), and engineering (structural failures). We show that decisions that minimize the likelihood of catastrophic events must be based on cross-scale interactions, and such decisions will often be counterintuitive. Given the continuing challenges associated with global change, approaches that cross disciplinary boundaries to include interactions and feedbacks at multiple scales are needed to increase our ability to predict catastrophic events and develop strategies for minimizing their occurrence and impacts. Our framework is an important step in developing predictive tools and designing experiments to examine cross-scale interactions.},

Although open urban systems have been increasingly identified as the best fields for flourishing resilience and city diversity, the current practice of planning and urban design focuses mainly on master plans, which tend to behave as closed systems, pretending to predict and overly control the future development of pre-defined bounded areas. By exploring this contradiction, the present paper attempts to frame a design and research approach that can steer emergent changes in positive directions without trying to formally predetermine their final outcome.},

In this paper, the author considers six cases of urban street networks characterized by different patterns and historical roots. The authors propose a representation of the street networks based firstly on a primal graph, where intersections are turned into nodes and streets into edges. In a second step, a dual graph, where streets are nodes and intersections are edges, is constructed by means of a generalization model named Intersection Continuity Negotiation, which allows to acknowledge the continuity of streets over a plurality of edges. Finally, the authors address a comparative study of some structural properties of the dual graphs, seeking significant similarities among clusters of cases. A wide set of network analysis techniques are implemented over the dual graph: in particular the authors show that the absence of any clue of assortativity differentiates urban street networks from other non-geographic systems and that most of the considered networks have a broad degree distribution typical of scale-free networks and exhibit small-world properties as well.},

Space is located among the `hard' sciences as a central term in the attempt of geography to transform the discipline from a descriptive into a quantitative, analytic, and thus scientific, enterprise. Place, on the other hand, is located among the `soft' humanities and social philosophy oriented social sciences as an important notion in the post-1970 attempt to transform geography from a positivistic into a humanistic, structuralist, hermeneutic, critical science. More recently, the place-oriented geographies have adopted postmodern, poststructuralist, and deconstruction approaches, while the quantitative spatial geographies have been strongly influenced by theories of self-organization and complexity. In this paper I first point to, and then explore, structural similarities between complexity theories and theories oriented toward social philosophy. I then elaborate the thesis that, in consequence, complexity theories have the potential to bridge the geographies of space and place and, by implication, the two cultures of science. Finally, discuss in some detail conceptual and methodological implications.},

The model developed in this paper treats as endogenous the urban spatial distribution of residential location, structure density, commuting behavior, and energy use, facilitating a general equilibrium energy accounting of policies affecting transportation costs or land use. We calibrate this model with respect to five monocentric Brazilian cities in order to assess the implications three distinct policies: a change in the gasoline price, vehicle fuel efficiency regulations, and a change in the price of agricultural land. Gasoline price increases reduce energy consumption directly though reduced commuting and indirectly through higher residential density. On the other hand, while fuel efficiency regulations reduce energy consumption in total, the direct effect is somewhat offset by the indirect effect of sprawl which increases energy consumption. Increases to the price of agricultural land increase the energy efficiency of the city by increasing density and shortening commutes.},

In this article, we consider one particular way of collaboration in an experimental setting: Urban Living Labs (ULLs). ULLs are understood as spatially embedded sites for the co-creation of knowledge and solutions by conducting local experiments. As such, ULLs are supposed to offer an arena for reflexive, adaptive, and multi-actor learning environments, where new practices of self-organization and novel (infra-) structures can be tested within their real-world context. Yet, it remains understudied how the co-creation of knowledge and practices actually takes place within ULLs, and how co-creation unfolds their impacts. Hence, this paper focuses on co-creation dynamics in urban living labs, its associated learning and knowledge generation, and how these possibly contribute to urban sustainability transitions. We analyzed empirical data from a series of in-depth interviews and were actively involved with ULLs in the Rotterdam-The Hague region in the Netherlands. Our findings show five distinct types of co-creation elements that relate to specific dynamics of participation, facilitation, and organization. We conclude with a discussion on the ambivalent role of contextualized knowledge and the implications for sustainability transitions.},

  abstract = {Generative design is a fast-growing design approach that is both important and pervasive. This approach has developed after the great digital revolution in the last few decades, especially during the first two decades of the third millennium. Taking advantage of the computational capabilities of modern computers, generative design offers designers the ability to test multiple and complex alternatives by automating design processes using algorithms. The automation makes it possible to manage an ever increasing number of variables and parameters that are difficult to manage manually. This paper presents an attempt to classify the approaches of the generative urban design methodologies applied in the field today, with the aim of highlighting the gaps in the current practices. By reviewing the previous available studies that dealt with the idea of generative urban design, we find that they can be classified according to the approach they adopt in four categories: the first is the approach of deforming or distorting a basic shape proposed by the designer, the second is the approach stemming from the simulation of real urban growth, while the third is the approach of dealing with the urban form on the scale of building blocks without being concerned with the spatial network, and finally the fourth is the approach that emerges from analysing a realistic spatial structure and then proposing modifications based on the results of the analysis. From this review, the paper proposes a new approach resulting from the analysis of a realistic spatial structure to build a generic model that can be the starting point of a synthetic process to be integrated into a generative design methodology.},

This period included the first systematic empirical analysis of the forces affecting the location of firms and households within cities. Robert Murray Haig (1926) and a number of other microeconomists at Columbia analyzed the spatial patterns of manufacturing activity in lower Manhattan and in the rest of New York City. Haig and his colleagues devoted considerable attention to ``where things `belong' in an urban area'' (p. 402), providing the first systematic economic analysis of urban spatial structure. For example, they analyzed the garment industry, concluding that it was destined ``by nature'' to disperse north of 14th Street, and predicting that it would follow the established spatial pattern of the cooperage (barrelmaking) industry. Standardization in size and quality of barrels had meant that identical barrels could be made throughout the New York metropolitan area, even in New Jersey, and the introduction of the truck meant that they could be transported cheaply throughout the region and exported},

At present, RaTG13 is only available on the public database in the form of a genome sequence. The genome of RaTG13 (MN996532.1) was sequenced from the RNA of a bat faecal swab collected in 2013 from Yunnan, China, however the exact location is not mentioned. Since RaTG13 is one of the main supports for SARS-CoV-2 to have a natural origin, it is of utmost importance to understand the sample location. RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) sequence of RaTG13 shows that it is 100\% similar to that of bat corona virus BtCoV/4991 and 98.7-98.9\% similar to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp 2. BtCoV/4991 was described to be a SARS-like (SL-) corona virus from bat faeces sampled in an abandoned mine from Mojiang 2. Both the publications 1,2 are authored by Dr. Zheng-li Shi (Z-L Shi), who is described as the bat woman of China 3. However, BtCoV/4991 has not been mentioned by Zhou et al 2020 1 where novel corona virus was first described. Based on the RdRp sequence similarities, similarities in sample collection dates, sample locations, and the fact that RaTG13 is mentioned synonymous to BtCoV/4991 on the Chinese bat database, it is predicted that RaTG13 and BtCoV/4991 originate from the same sample. The sample, bat faecal swab was collected in 2013 from an abandoned mineshaft in Mojiang by Dr. Shi and her work group. In 2012, in a Mojiang mineshaft, six mine workers suffered from atypical pneumonia and three of them died. These workers were engaged in the work of clearing debris from a mineshaft which had a lot of bats and bat faeces 3,4. A detailed health investigation indicated that the miners suffered from atypical pneumonia mostly of the viral origin 4. Therefore, in the light of the present Covid-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, the fact that its phylogenetic neighbour RaTG13 originated from bat faeces collected from a mineshaft, which was also the origin of pneumonia-like disease in miners in 2012, should be noted.},

The novelty of this tool lies in considering the topographic constraints of the site and generating various alternatives of urban design scenarios accordingly. For the purposes of this research, San Diego has been chosen as an example of a steep city with varied topography that, in consequence, has created distinct urban typologies within the city. With the use of shape grammars, the rules and patterns forming the urban structure of each typology have been decodified. The extracted urban shape grammar is then used as the basis for a generative design tool producing various urban design scenarios considering the limitations and potential of the site's topology. This paper describes the extracted urban shape grammars and how that informs the development of the presented generative urban design tool.},

The modelling of pedestrian movements and the ability to predict the travel time are useful for evaluating the performance of a pedestrian facility. However, only a few studies can be found that incorporate the design of the facility, local pedestrian body dimensions, the delay experienced by the pedestrians, and level of service to the pedestrian movements. In this paper, a queuing based analytical model is developed as a function of relevant determinants and functional factors to predict the travel time on pedestrian facilities. The model can be used to assess the overall serving rate or performance of a facility layout and correlate it to the level of service that is possible to provide the pedestrians. It has also the ability to provide a clear suggestion on the designing and sizing of pedestrian facilities. The model is empirically validated and is found to be a robust tool to understand how well a particular walking facility makes possible comfort and convenient pedestrian movements. The sensitivity analysis is also performed to see the impact of some crucial parameters of the developed model on the performance of pedestrian facilities.},

  abstract = {In classical urban planning, land use segregation and zoning regulations have been practiced by the city planners as the mainstream guiding principles in shaping cities. In spite of many advantages, such land use segregation \& zoning regulations, over the last few decades, have been critiqued by scholars for many adverse conditions. Such as 1) isolation and lack of vitality, 2) longer home-work distance and travel cost, 3) unsuitable environment for small investments, 4) higher travel cost for facilities, amenities and thereby increased expenditure, 5) safety issues, etc. As a solution, mixed land use (MLU) has been advocated as a strategy to avoid such limitations and adverse conditions. In addition, MLU offers other advantages like 1) housing variety and density, 2) creation of an economic blend of compatible land uses, 3) compact development, 4) stronger neighborhood character, 5) walkability, 6) job generation, etc. However, MLU always may not produce such advantages. For example, mixing multiple land uses beyond a suitable proportion can also bring unwanted conditions like traffic congestion, encroachments, unintended very high-density housing, parking spill out, non-residential uses operating on residential premises paying less tax, chaos and noise, stressed infrastructure, etc. Nevertheless, MLU has been advocated largely in all international urban forums and scholarly discourses. Still, operationalizing the concept of MLU in an appropriate balance has not been streamlined due to various confusions and research gaps. The current paper addresses those confusions through a thorough discussion from literature and clarifies the concept of MLU with clear classifications and differentiation as a significant basis for further research and practice.},

Statutory planning in Finland, like in many other European countries, is built on the principles of hierarchical three-level zoning and area reservation codes. The zoning system reflects two historical tasks: the industrialising society's need to separate uses and the post-war desire for hierarchical administrative structures. Both these demands are rapidly losing their importance. The article focuses on current urban planning practices and planning rules, discussing their limitations to cope with urban complexity and selforganised dynamics, and aiming to develop new rules that could potentially turn complexity into an asset. Evolving digital technologies provide completely new opportunities for developing urban planning into a more transparent and interactive tool. In this framework, we set out to study the development potentials of planning rules in Finland, where the drafting of a new Land Use and Building Act is currently underway calling for a reassessment of the operative role of the planning system.},

  abstract = {The application of activity-based models of travel demand to planning practice has triggered interest in issues that potentially improve the accuracy and/or usefulness of model forecasts. The limited knowledge of uncertainty propagation in complex stochastic model systems has put uncertainty analysis high on the research agenda to differentiate between simulation error and policy effects. Focusing on transport mode choice, this paper draws attention to the use of model ensembles, which has hardly been explored in travel demand forecasting. Prior studies predicting transport mode choice has typically relied on a single equation, relating observed transport mode choices to a set of personal and contextual variables. The estimated single model is then assumed to apply to all individuals. This paper explores the idea of replacing a single equation/representation with an ensemble of model predictions, using the decision tree formalism. Potentially, ensembles better capture the notion that travellers may use different heuristics in their transport mode decisions. The aim of the study is to investigate whether the use of a model ensemble of different decision heuristics will reduce the error/uncertainty in predicting transport mode decisions. Results of the study, conducted in the Rotterdam region, The Netherlands, suggest that the accuracy of predicting transport mode choice is improved, albeit non-monotonically, with increasing ensemble size. Simultaneously, the uncertainty related to these predictions is decreasing. Finally, it is shown that the importance of the selected explanatory variables co-varies with ensemble size. Estimation results tend to become stable in this study with an ensemble size of approximately 20 decision trees.},

In response, planning approaches which move away from the ambition to achieve predefined outcomes are being explored in the literature. One of them is an adaptive approach to planning. In this paper, we argue that adaptive planning comes with a shift in focus. Instead of content and process, it is first of all about creating conditions for development which support a city's capacity to respond to changing circumstances. We explore what these conditions may comprise and how they can be related to planning. First theoretically, by portraying cities as complex adaptive systems. Then empirically, through an evaluation of the practice of organic development strategies in which development trajectories are only minimally structured. Based on a review of 12 Dutch urban development projects, two of which are analysed in detail in this paper, we identify a series of conditions on spatio-functional configurations and the capacity building of local actors which enhance urban adaptability.},

  abstract = {Can a virtual city game be built by both the public and computer-based on real-site data? In the current process of deepening global connectivity, requirements for an effective urban design are no longer limited to functions or aesthetics, but a smart, dynamic complex with multi-interactions of data, group behaviours, and physical space. This paper introduces the logic of swarm intelligence and particle system for proposing a new urban design methodology. The platforms range from simulations that quantify the impact of the disruptive interventions of city activities to communicable collaboration between different users in a UI system, which creates virtual connections between optimized urbanscape and users. In the design system, based on the context data, the computer firstly simulates and optimizes the existing 2D activity joints between the people and analyzed the current spatial connection nodes into certain design rules. Through optimal programming for spatial connection and data iterations, the activity connection structures in the second simulation are abstracted into a set of interactive 3D topographic. The final data-visualization results are presented as a co-building megacity in a virtual construction game. Users can choose the virtual building unit types and intuitively influence the future urbanscape decision through virtual construction.},

Each station area is classified as a transit-oriented development (TOD), hybrid, or transit-adjacent development (TAD) based on walkability and housing density targets. Station areas with a Walk Score of 70 or greater and a gross housing density of 8 units per acre or more are classified as TOD. Station areas that meet just one of these criteria are classified as hybrids, and those that do not meet either of these criteria are categorized as TAD. The findings reveal a paradox that whereas TOD are more expensive places to buy and rent housing, they are more affordable than hybrids and TAD because the lower cost of transportation offsets housing costs. We argue that policies to increase the density and walkability of hybrid and TAD station areas, which account for two thirds of all station areas across the United States, should be a top priority for both housing and transportation officials.},

  abstract = {COVID-19 is a present-day complex pandemic infection with unpredictable levels of morbidity and mortality in various global populations. COVID-19 is associated with the different comorbidities with its change in biological function such as causing heart dysfunction via deregulating ACE-2 receptor, gastrointestinal risk via causing vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, chronic kidney disease via proteinuria and hematuria, diabetes mellitus, liver injury via increasing ALT, AST and bilirubin level, lung injury, CNS risk, ocular risk, and cancer risk. In this, we are focused on the COVID-19 connected with male infertility. Some of the studies show that the patients of COVID-19 are associated with impaired spermatogenesis. Impaired spermatogenesis via COVID-19 decreases the level of testosterone by disturbing cytokines such as TNF-{$\alpha$}, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-12 and further, attenuates the sperm count. COVID-19 is causing inflammation via TNF-{$\alpha$} and interferons. IL-4 plays an eminent role in the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway and leads to the disturbing pro-inflammatory cytokine as well as further cause's male infertility. Th2 activates the IL-4 through IgG and IgE and mediates apoptosis with the triggering of STAT signaling. The activated STAT signaling augments Batf/Irf4, and the Bach2/Batf pathway. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 is activating the level of Th2 cells. So, we hypothesized that the augmented Th2 cells would disturb the level of IL-4, JAK-STAT signaling, Batf/Irf4, and Bach2/Batf pathway. The disturbed IL-4 decreases the level of the ACE-2 with the inflammation. This further leads to male infertility in COVID-19 patients. So, in this hypothesis, we focused on the role of IL-4 in COVID-19 patients associated with male infertility via Th2 cells and JAK-STAT signaling.},

In this chapter it is argued that the choice of a place of residence is a strategic decision that enables individuals or households to gain locational advantages that are crucial in negotiating and mastering the spatial aspects of everyday life. The term `spatial capital' has been used to conceptualise these locational advantages, revealing them to be an additional form of class-led appropriation of urban resources. The conceptualisation of spatial capital allows for the opportunity to re-read gentrification through the lenses of mobility. In this chapter the gentrification studies literature is read using spatial capital as a guiding thread and the concept of spatial capital is broadened by extending the lens of analysis to the planetary scale.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The study is carried out on Canada's least and most expensive major metropolitan housing markets, Montreal and Vancouver.

It is found that the road then built is wider everywhere than the road in the fully optimum case. Hence, if taxes and regulations will eventually be imposed to reduce the gap between the social and private cost of commuting, possibly too much land is now used for roads in American cities.},

An important aspect of these externalities that has not been previously emphasized is that the effects of agglomeration extend over at least three different dimensions. These are the industrial, geographic, and temporal scope of economic agglomeration economies. In each case, the literature suggests that agglomeration economies attenuate with distance. Recently, the literature has also begun to provide evidence on the microfoundations of external economies of scale. The best known of these sources are those attributed to Marshall (1920): labor market pooling, input sharing, and knowledge spillovers. Evidence to date supports the presence of all three of these forces. In addition, there is also evidence that natural advantage, home market effects, consumption opportunities, and rent-seeking all contribute to agglomeration.},

The methods presented here are intended to create a framework that may be applied to any city in order to assess the built environment and provide useful information to city planners and policy-makers.

Recent revolutionary results of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) foreshadow the advent of reliable classifiers to perform such visual tasks. However, DCNNs require learning of many parameters from raw images; thus, having a sufficient amount of diverse images with class annotations is needed. These annotations are obtained via cumbersome, human labour which is particularly challenging for semantic segmentation since pixel-level annotations are required. In this paper, we propose to use a virtual world to automatically generate realistic synthetic images with pixel-level annotations. Then, we address the question of how useful such data can be for semantic segmentation \textendash{} in particular, when using a DCNN paradigm. In order to answer this question we have generated a synthetic collection of diverse urban images, named SYNTHIA, with automatically generated class annotations. We use SYNTHIA in combination with publicly available real-world urban images with manually provided annotations. Then, we conduct experiments with DCNNs that show how the inclusion of SYNTHIA in the training stage significantly improves performance on the semantic segmentation task.},

Drawing on census data and local regulatory indicators compiled by Pendall, the authors estimate a series of regression models to measure the effect of maximum density zoning on Black segregation. Results estimated using ordinary least squares indicate a strong and significant cross-sectional relationship between low-density zoning and racial segregation, even after controlling for other zoning policies and a variety of metropolitan characteristics, a relationship that persists under two-stage least squares estimation. Both estimation strategies also suggest that anti-density zoning inhibits desegregation over time.},

  abstract = {Though local land regulations have been studied extensively, few papers have studies how these regulations affect metropolitan markets, and of these, very few have been able to identify specific policies that drive the results. Instead scholars have relied on composite indexes, which are empirically noisy and generally taken as exogenous. The primary contribution of this paper is to use uniquely comprehensive survey data and multiple sources of information to clarify which regulations are the most important. Furthermore, a theoretical model of zoning is sketched, modeling it as a function of historic rural settlement patterns in order to limit taxation.  Empirical evidence supports the theory on zoning's origins and allows zoning to endogenously affect housing markets. The results of both this technique and simple OLS regressions suggest that roughly 20\% of the variation in metropolitan housing growth can be explained through density regulations, and this result is remarkably robust to an alternative measurements and assumptions about other land regulations. The results further show that anti-density regulation inflates prices in the face of demand shocks.},

  abstract = {Housing affordability is traditionally measured using the percentage of household income spent on housing. An important cost that is usually overlooked in measuring location affordability is the transportation or accessibility costs. In this paper, we present a modeling approach, driven by urban open data, to measure location affordability that incorporates both housing and transportation costs. We apply the developed model to assess housing affordability in Melbourne, Australia as a case study. Results suggest that neighbourhoods that appear to be affordable when only housing cost is considered are not necessarily affordable when transportation costs are taken into account. A negative correlation between housing affordability and transportation affordability is observed. We also identify the presence of a strong spatial clustering pattern in the affordability measure across the study area. A major methodological contribution of the paper is the inclusion of comprehensive private vehicle costs and public transportation expenses in the model that contributes to a more robust estimation and understanding of location affordability. The model also distinguishes between different trip purposes. Results suggest that plans and policies to improve housing affordability should be made in coordination with transportation infrastructure investment plans to ensure effective and equitable outcomes. Nevertheless, the focus of the paper is more on the measurement of affordability; rather than reviewing and recommending housing related policies.},

The cost\textendash benefit analyses take into account the benefit of reduced insecurity and the health benefits of the improved fitness the use of non-motorized transport provides. In addition to reductions in health costs, the analyses also take into account that a change from travel by car to cycling or walking means reduced external costs (e.g. air pollution and noise) from motorized traffic and reduced parking costs. The benefits of investments in cycle networks are estimated to be at least 4\textendash 5 times the costs. Such investments are thus more beneficial to society than other transport investments. The results of such complete cost\textendash benefit analyses make it possible to calculate the benefits to society that are not realized because motorized traffic prevents people from bicycling or walking as much as they otherwise would prefer. These ``barrier costs'' attributable to motorized traffic are estimated to be of at least the same magnitude as air pollution costs and more than double the noise costs. Barrier costs should therefore be taken into account in the same way as other external costs, when the issue is to determine the proper level of car taxes or to evaluate different kinds of restrictions on car use.},

In addition, the purpose of this study is to compare more closely the two different methods, artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple regression analysis (MRA), and find out which of the methods is more accurate in determining the prices of apartment buildings in the Helsinki area.  
 The data used in the research has been collected from the Confederation of Finnish Real Estate's database and from the website of the Finnish Tax Administration. The combined data contains information about apartments in Helsinki. In addition to the housing information, the data contains regional income data. The research material of this study was analyzed using an artificial neural network as well as multiple regression analysis.  
 This research finds that the most often used residential real estate valuation method in the previous literature is the multiple regression method. The second most common is the hedonic pricing and 3rd common is the artificial neural network model. In the analysis section of this study, the artificial neural network model proved to be the most accurate way to estimate the prices of apartment buildings in Helsinki. According to this study, the most important variables influencing the price of an apartment were: number of square meters of the apartment, income level of the area, form of ownership of the plot and the condition of the apartment. In addition, the study found that in some cases the location of the apartment has a significant impact on the price.},

I find that rents increased from 8\% to 11\% more in Miami than in the comparison groups between 1979 and 1981. By 1983 the rent differential was still 7\%. Rental units of higher quality were not affected by the immigration shock. Units occupied by low-income Hispanic residents in 1979 experienced an extra 8\% differential hike with respect to other low-income units.

Part III continues with a detailed examination of how the land use regulatory system can be used to promote small-scale renewable energy by employing traditional zoning techniques, asserting that without an appropriate local land use regime, the incentives reviewed in Part II cannot be effectively utilized. Part IV concludes with a warning to local governments that if they fail to accommodate the emerging federal and state policies supporting the siting of renewable energy sources, they may face preemptive statutory measures in the area of land use regulation. This creates perhaps the greatest incentive for local governments to plan and regulate responsibly for promoting the appropriate use of small-scale renewable energy.},

Many municipalities lack the resources to develop energy and emissions-reducing policy interventions appropriate to their characteristics. This research synthesises urban form, scenario analysis and energy simulation into a cohesive workflow for evaluating energy and emissions policy interventions across a range of urban forms. A geospatial and census analysis of six cities across British Columbia, Canada, led to the development of seven urban neighborhood patterns. These represent neighborhood forms and densities found in cities of various sizes, densities, forms and climates. To test the approach of an urban built environment model (UBEM), retrofit and infill redevelopment `what-if' scenarios were applied iteratively to two sample patterns comparing the relative efficacy of building technology-improvement policies versus land-use intensification policies. The future `what-if' policy scenarios were spatially tested and validated using relevant policy. The simplified UBEM methods applied to typical patterns and development demonstrates a step towards an accessible and flexible modeling approach. Small and medium-sized municipalities can use this approach to assess and compare potential energy and emissions policy options and outcomes at building and neighborhood scales. ~ Practice relevance A new, simple method has been created for municipalities to understand multiple `what-if' scenarios for reducing energy demand and emissions from buildings. This is based on profiles from census data, geospatial analysis and energy data that characterise urban neighborhood patterns. The approach integrates building-scale and neighborhood-scale energy and greenhouse gas simulations. It can simulate a variety of policy scenarios and strategy interventions in order to show the interactions between and among urban form and retrofit options. This enables planners and decision-makers to compare the relative magnitudes of different interventions at the neighborhood or city level for energy and emissions performance. The model was developed for use by a variety of communities in British Columbia, Canada. There is potential for adapting this method for use in other locations.},

Thus, the article aims at reporting the experience of understanding aimed at mapping the spatial distribution of the occurrences crimes of violence against property in Jo\~ao Pessoa \textendash{} Para\'iba - Brazil, in the month of May 2012, presenting the phenomenon in thematic maps, which show the points where there are crimes with firearms and knives, as well as the map of high-density areas of crime. Specifically with the conclusion of this article can be identified as the cartography is useful for spatial analysis and may subsidize actions of municipal, state and federal, and local civil society, aimed at combating violence and crime in the city. The results shows that the mapping crime or any other phenomenon is important because it allows to know how it is distributed through space, and thus able to monitor mitigation policies. Therefore, the Cartography occupies an important place among the sciences to help fight crime, since based on a map with the spatial distribution of crimes in an area can provide efficient operational safety features. By analyzing the maps it is clear that the amount of crimes using firearms was very big, so it would be interesting to disarmament campaigns in neighborhoods, followed by installation of core security on site, minimizing the increase in cases of crimes violence against property. Cartography and crime mapping analysis can assist in planning, and implementation of action plans to minimize the cost of operations and more effectively, since the study area is already known and the whole strategy can be applied.},

  abstract = {Squares are urban public open spaces whose use combines a number of  elements that can provide their vitality, some of which can be enhanced through  strategic projects. Given this general framework, the starting question which  triggered this thesis: Would the elements that the literature indicate influence the  vitality of the squares be perceived by their users? The hypothesis put forward  was that users give priority to elements directly involved in the appropriation of  space, especially the furniture and existing equipment, levels of shade and  security. The focus of empirical research were public squares located in the city  of Natal-RN, with the aim to identify elements that contribute to the vitality of the  public squares in the city, through the relationship between spatial morphology  and environmental awareness. The methodology adopted was a Case Study  conducted by multimethod, using the following procedures: morphological  analysis based on literature and information at three levels (radius of influence,  500m; immediate surroundings; environment itself); systematic observation  (behavioral mapping centred in the location); and semi-structured interviews with  users. The results showed that the public spaces more integrated in the urban  areas have greater potential for use, however, its effective use depends on the  perception of individuals, so that its vitality is mainly due to items identified by  users as central to their continued presence in the environment because they  directly affect their wellbeing and the image of the location. So some elements,  notably furniture and urban equipment, are more easily detected than others,  revealing that they are essential to the perception of users, so that their presence,  quality and location appeared to have greater impact on use. In addition, the  amount of shade and security showed as items that ensure that individuals  experience public spaces more often, since the (likely) users are aware of the  conservation actions or abandonment that take place on these sites, revealing  itself to be potentially involved in the rescue of these spaces. Overall, the general  hypothesis is only partially proven because in many situations, the vitality of  squares appeared not only to be related to the elements investigated, but also  additional aspects - environmental, nature, economic, social and cultural - which  should also be studied.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive understanding of neighborhood facilities distribution and functions along with residential quality of life satisfaction is a key asset for relating livability management to transportation networks. Due to the simultaneous involvement of varied factors with an individual's perception of livability, this concept is difficult to measure. Therefore, a more objective means of quantifying livability is needed. The service industry has demonstrated the intersection of machine learning classifiers and survey domain knowledge for evaluating users' quality of experiences; however, this process of inquiry-based learning has never been considered for solving the communication difficulties between community stakeholders and transportation agencies. Another area of overlap is that of urban computing, which integrates computing technology in the traditional context of urban areas, connecting ubiquitous sensing technologies, computational power, and data about the urban environment to promote quality of life for people living in a particular community. To this aim, the focus of this study is on interpreting a linkage between society stated preferences and quantitative measures of livability by extracting information from survey-based methods and translating it to a quantitative framework using combined service industry and urban computing methodologies. This work focuses on four transportation planning-related research questions in this blended framework: understanding existing livability patterns, predicting heterogeneous perceptions of quality of life, prioritizing public preferences, and developing a multidimensional livability index (MLI).},

Two cases from Amsterdam are presented to demonstrate that development contracts signed between governments and private sector developers are more rigid than zoning regulations in the face of changing circumstances. The paper concludes that, instead of deregulation, a careful articulation of different legal instruments can enhance adaptive capacity.},

In particular, municipalities are experimenting with more open-ended, incremental and co-produced forms of urbanism that aim to reform existent supply-led urban development models. This paper shows that these practices underlie a neoliberal reform of public spending and that they have important socio-political implications for urban welfare. By discussing the relation between uncertainty and risk, it shows that recent reforms of urban development policies do not reduce risk but rather reorganize it in two ways. First, by resizing the time horizon of action and prioritizing short-term delivery, and second, by simultaneously privatizing and collectivizing risk to individuals and public budgets. An in-depth analysis of recent reforms in Amsterdam public financing model is provided. This paper concludes that a risk-sensitive view of planning innovation is today necessary in order to address future socio-economic challenges of urban change.},

Recent political discourse on new localism and liberal individualism builds on a similar understanding of cities, giving responsibility to citizens and their collective associations in light of state rescaling. The consequences of such perspectives for urban development have yet to be conceptualized. This article proposes a critique of the use of self-organization in policy practice, building on the argument that this concept destabilizes two constitutive categories of urban intervention: spatial boundaries and temporal programmes. In so doing, self-organization conveys two peculiar understandings of agency in city-regional spaces and of urbanity: the disaggregation of city-regions and the deconstruction of urbanity. Looking at the recent change in Amsterdam's urban development practice, I show that, while self-organization is used to emphasize that city-regions constitute interconnected systems of dynamics, when applied in policymaking it in fact leads to the disaggregation and fragmentation of urban regions. Moreover, while the capacity of self-organization to deconstruct codified notions of urbanity that frustrate urban relations is often celebrated, its use in policy produces newly exclusive urban fabrics.},

Despite the great effort invested in their creation and maintenance, even the largest (e.g., Yago, DBPedia or Wikidata) remain incomplete. We introduce Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCNs) and apply them to two standard knowledge base completion tasks: Link prediction (recovery of missing facts, i.e. subject-predicate-object triples) and entity classification (recovery of missing entity attributes). RGCNs are related to a recent class of neural networks operating on graphs, and are developed specifically to deal with the highly multi-relational data characteristic of realistic knowledge bases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of R-GCNs as a stand-alone model for entity classification. We further show that factorization models for link prediction such as DistMult can be significantly improved by enriching them with an encoder model to accumulate evidence over multiple inference steps in the relational graph, demonstrating a large improvement of 29.8\% on FB15k-237 over a decoder-only baseline.},

In our study of the Kuninkaankolmio area (located in the Helsinki metropolitan region) the survey data were combined with urban density variables calculated from register-based data on the existing built environment. The regression analysis indicated that the participants in the survey preferred the same density factors for their future residence as they enjoyed in their current neighbourhood. In the second analysis we related the densities of planned infill developments with the interest respondents had shown in these projects. The results show that new and even quite dense infill developments have been found to be rather attractive, with them often being viewed as interesting supplements to the current urban texture. These findings contribute to the ongoing scientific discussion on the feasibility of densification measures and encourage the Kuninkaankolmio planners to proceed, albeit carefully, with the planned infill developments.},

The recent urban regulations are criticised regards the inefficient data exchange, ungearing across two-dimensional provisions and three-dimensional constructions, as well as unpredictable development results. Although various attempts have been made to utilise parametric design instruments in urban scale, most of them are only for modelling fast. This paper proposes a parametric methodology on algorithm platforms to offer a rational workflow for urban design regulating. The workflow includes three phases: (1) data integrating, (2) form-based regulation modelling, and (3) object-oriented regulation modelling. Rhinoceros 3DTM, Grasshopper 3DTM, and related plug-ins are employed as modelling and data analysing instruments. The proposed workflow is examined and evaluated through experimenting with real-world contexts. This paper further demonstrates that parametric methodologies provide a high-quality contribution to decision-making and urban regulating in next 50 years.},

This study fills the missing link between these two bodies of literature by developing a standard methodology for measuring bicycle facility network quality at the macroscopic level and testing its association with bicycle commuting. Bicycle infrastructure maps were collected for 74 Unites States cities and systematically analyzed to evaluate their network structure. Linear regression models revealed that connectivity and directness are important factors in predicting bicycle commuting after controlling for demographic variables and the size of the city. These findings provide a framework for transportation planners and policymakers to evaluate their local bicycle facility networks and set regional priorities that support nonmotorized travel behavior, and for continued research on the structure and quality of bicycle infrastructure and behavior.},

Local zoning and other forms of land use regulation are believed to contribute to increased housing prices by reducing supply and increasing the size of new housing. Suburban restrictions on rental housing are particularly likely to reduce mobility for low-income families. In this paper, I employ an instrumental variables approach to examine the effects of zoning on the quantity and price of rental housing in Massachusetts, using historical municipal characteristics to instrument for current regulations. Results suggest that communities with more restrictive zoning issue significantly fewer building permits for multifamily housing but provide only weak evidence of the effects of regulations on rents. The lack of effects on rents may reflect the low level of multifamily development, while analysis is complicated by development of subsidized housing under the state's affordable housing law. \textcopyright{} 2009 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.},

Using data from the San Francisco Bay Area, we find that neighborhood type dissonance is statistically significantly associated with commute mode choice: dissonant urban residents are more likely to commute by private vehicle than consonant urbanites but not quite as likely as true suburbanites. However, differences between neighborhoods tend to be larger than between consonant and dissonant residents within a neighborhood. Physical neighborhood structure thus appears to have an autonomous impact on commute mode choice. The analysis also shows that the impact of neighborhood type dissonance interacts with that of commuters\~O beliefs about automobile use, suggesting that these are to be reckoned with when studying the joint choices of residential location and commute mode.},

The furin cleavage site in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was previously not identified in other SARS-like CoVs and might have conferred the ability to cross species and tissue barriers. Chimeric viruses can be the product of natural recombination or genetic manipulation. The latter could have aimed to identify pangolins as possible intermediate hosts for bat-CoV potentially pathogenic for humans. Theories that consider a possible artificial origin for SARS-CoV-2 are censored as they seem to support conspiracy theories.

Genomic analyses show SARS-CoV-2 likely to be chimeric, most of its sequence closest to bat CoV RaTG13, whereas its receptor binding domain (RBD) is almost identical to that of a pangolin CoV. Chimeric viruses can arise via natural recombination or human intervention. The furin cleavage site in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 confers to the virus the ability to cross species and tissue barriers, but was previously unseen in other SARS-like CoVs. Might genetic manipulations have been performed in order to evaluate pangolins as possible intermediate hosts for bat-derived CoVs that were originally unable to bind to human receptors? Both cleavage site and specific RBD could result from site-directed mutagenesis, a procedure that does not leave a trace.

While recognizing the many successes of the ``Vancouverism'' model, the contributors acknowledge that the forces of globalization and speculative property development have increased social inequality and housing insecurity since the 1980s in the city and the region. To determine the city's prospects for overcoming these problems, they look at city planning from all angles, including planning for the Indigenous population, environmental and disaster planning, housing and migration, and transportation and water management. By looking at policies at the local, provincial, and federal levels and taking reconciliation with Indigenous peoples into account, Planning on the Edge highlights the kinds of policies and practices needed to reorient Vancouver's development trajectory along a more environmentally sound and equitable path.},

Does a beautiful outdoor location differ from an outdoor location that is simply natural? Here, we explore whether ratings of over 200\,000 images of Great Britain from the online game Scenic-Or-Not, combined with hundreds of image features extracted using the Places Convolutional Neural Network, might help us understand what beautiful outdoor spaces are composed of. We discover that, as well as natural features such as `Coast', `Mountain' and `Canal Natural', man-made structures such as `Tower', `Castle' and `Viaduct' lead to places being considered more scenic. Importantly, while scenes containing `Trees' tend to rate highly, places containing more bland natural green features such as `Grass' and `Athletic Fields' are considered less scenic. We also find that a neural network can be trained to automatically identify scenic places, and that this network highlights both natural and built locations. Our findings demonstrate how online data combined with neural networks can provide a deeper understanding of what environments we might find beautiful and offer quantitative insights for policymakers charged with design and protection of our built and natural environments.},

The graphic user interface of the model allows a planner to flexibly test different size and placement scenarios with instantaneous feedback on the estimated patronage to different centres. Second, the tool also includes a simulation environment that allows the user to automatically test numerous combinations of centre sizes at given locations in order to maximize collective patronage across all clusters in the system. The latter functionality can help planners determine the size combination of retail clusters that maximizes overall shopper utility, leading to greatest patronage of commercial clusters in the system as a whole. Both functions of the tool can be integrated with existing, unchangeable retail developments. Outcomes in shopping behavior can also be tested against changes in network geometry \textendash{} e.g walking routes leading to centres \textendash{} or changes in demand locations.},

Though variations in these indicators may stem from historic contexts, policies, institutional arrangements, social and cultural origins, the spatial structure of metropolitan areas\textemdash in particular their formal characteristics\textemdash may also be a contributing factor. To test this relationship, we identify metropolitan form metrics from prior literature that are expected to impact transportation outcomes, and choose five metrics to which we introduce significant improvements. We apply the metrics to all 166 Combined Statistical Areas in the US, using an open-source GIS toolbox released along with the paper. Our findings demonstrate that form-based metrics provide a better explanation to CO2 emissions, public transit accessibility, and commuting times in US metro areas than the simpler population size or density metrics typically used in practice. We also show that counter to prior literature on urban scaling laws and economies of scale, which have argued that larger cities and metro areas are more sustainable per capita, transport-related CO2 emissions and transit accessibility are actually less favorable in larger CSAs when controlling for formal characteristics of metropolitan areas. Instead of scale, compactness has the highest elasticity with respect to transportation sustainability of metro areas.},

It is depicted from the available data that the air quality in most major cities of the world has deteriorated to levels that make air quality management strategies necessary. This paper briefly accounts the air quality management capabilities of developed and developing countries and indicates that in developing nations, especially those in Asia, such capabilities are either absent or only rudimentary. The situation at Faisalabad is taken as an example. This paper is based on a study carried out to determine the spatial distribution of ``solid aerosols in Faisalabad environment''. As such, the scaled map of Faisalabad was scanned using syntax map method. A map showing the distribution was produced, probably the first of its kind for the city, which showed that the levels of ,,solid aerosols\quotedblbase{} in most locations are much above the average recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), European Academy of Quranic Studies (EAQS) and World Health Organization (WHO). In order to find out which model can be properly used for the pollutant concentration on it, the sensitive zone, medium zone and safe zone were developed respectively. However, the map was found misfit for classifying the zones, hence theoretical and remote sensing techniques were recommended for further improvement.},

We present a more natural representation of the solutions to Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems, within 3 Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) architectures to better exploit this inherent structure. The forward passes of each RCNN execute an efficient Value Iteration, propagate beliefs of state in partially observable environments, and choose optimal actions respectively. Applying back-propagation to these RCNNs allows the system to explicitly learn the Transition Model and Reward Function associated with the underlying MDP, serving as an elegant alternative to classical model-based RL. We evaluate the proposed algorithms in simulation, considering a robot planning problem. We demonstrate the capability of our framework to reduce the cost of re-planning, learn accurate MDP models, and finally re-plan with learned models to achieve near-optimal policies.},

In the past decade, several assessment tools worldwide have been developed to evaluate the effectiveness of the increasing number of neighborhood (re)development plans. While there is a plethora of research investigating various aspects of building assessment tools, until now little studies have looked at the empirical aspects of neighborhood sustainability assessment. To address this lacuna in literature, this study explores the uptake of sustainability criteria in projects certified under neighborhood sustainability assessment tools. In addition, it examines three cases from the US, the UK, and Japan that have been highly ranked under LEED-ND, BREEAM Communities, and CASBEE-UD, respectively. This is done through investigating compliance of each case with the principles of sustainable development. Furthermore, a series of comparative case studies are undertaken to evaluate each case using assessment tools other than the ones that have, in reality, been used for certifying the selected developments. Inaddition to highlighting strengths and weaknesses of each development, results show that social, economic, and institutional aspects are not adequately accounted for in theory and practice. Practice of neighborhood sustainability assessment is, to a large extent, market-driven and characterized by the dominance of the environmental aspects of sustainability. Also, results indicate that assessment tools can co-evolve through learning from their successes and failures. Results of this study can be used for optimizing the assessment tools. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {When drawing urban scale plans, designers should always define the position and the shape of each building. This process usually costs much time in the early design stage when the condition of a city has not been finally determined. Thus the designers spend a lot of time working forward and backward drawing sketches for different characteristics of cities. Meanwhile, machine learning, as a decision-making tool, has been widely used in many fields. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a model frame in machine learning, specially designed to learn and generate image data. Therefore, this research aims to apply GAN in creating urban design plans, helping designers automatically generate the predicted details of buildings configuration with a given condition of cities. Through the machine learning of image pairs, the result shows the relationship between the site conditions (roads, green lands, and rivers) and the configuration of buildings. This automatic design tool can help release the heavy load of urban designers in the early design stage, quickly providing a preview of design solutions for urban design tasks. The analysis of different machine learning models trained by the data from different cities inspires urban designers with design strategies and features in distinct conditions.},

To facilitate urban planners and designers tackle these problems at the early stage of their work, this paper proposes the idea of simulation-based urban form generation and optimization modeling. It connects parametric models of urban form generation to an optimization engine coupled with a widely available program of energy systems. To build up the model of simulation-based urban form generation and optimization modeling, this paper reviews the state-of-the-art of simulation-based design generation and optimization modeling and discusses its application on energy-driven urban design at the district scale. The paper compares the main generative methods and presents their limitations and advantages to aid energy-driven urban design. For the urban form generation modeling, the paper also reviews the most relevant approaches to urban morphology. These approaches help to define the urban elements for the urban form generation. Most of the existing design generation and optimization models are observed to consist of a workflow, a generative method, and a series of generation constraints. Based on this, the paper proposes a model of simulation-based urban form generation and optimization modeling for energy-driven urban design. The model consists of a workflow with three steps, a collection step, the generation step, and the optimization step. The constraints yet need to be defined. At the district scale, the model also has to work at an appropriate resolution and precision.},

It gives more attention to local management and it is dedicated to the study of objectives and actions developed, basically, by  two segments that manage works in the district. Companhia Docas do Rio Grande do Norte aims at the economical development of the state and it implies the enlargement of capacity of loading and unloading of the harbor of Natal and the Natal city counsil aims at urban preservation and revitalization. It was analysed speeches ans projects related to Ribeira and it  was discovered that Natal has done very little to revitalize its historical center in the last two dacades. It analyses what seemed, or at least, should be a conflict of interests between  incompatible projects, revealing both conciliatory proceedings and connivance between the participants in decision making. The conclusion directs attentions to the threat to historical  building in the city and the importance of enhancing discussion about the future of our historical sites},

The methodology combines the advantages of a spatially-explicit analysis with the prediction accuracy of neural networks to estimate the energy demand (for space heating, space cooling and mobility) resulting from the physical configuration of urban areas. The urban alternatives under assessment reflect a number of development strategies taking place in different locations within the city. These correspond to well-known urban development approaches (infill development, consolidated development, modern development, multi-family housing, transit-oriented development and green infrastructure). The results for the city of Porto show that the transit-oriented development, the urban infill and the consolidated development are the urban alternatives yielding the most relevant energy savings, especially regarding mobility needs. This study makes evident that planning for more efficient urban forms potentially brings about more efficient urban settings and reinforces the relevance of ex ante appraisals of urban projects and plans.},

Yet, research on urban form and energy remains sectorial and hasn't been able to deliver a full understanding of the impact of the physical structure of cities upon their energy demand. Most common approaches feature engineering models in buildings, and statistical models in transports. This study aims at contributing to the characterization of the link between urban form and energy considering altogether three distinct energy uses: ambient heating and cooling in buildings, and travel. A high-resolution methodology is proposed. It applies GIS to provide the analysis with a spatially-explicit character, and neural networks to model energy demand based on a set of relevant urban form indicators. The results confirm that the effect of urban form indicators on the overall energy needs is far from being negligible. In particular, the number of floors, the diversity of activities within a walking reach, the floor area and the subdivision of blocks evidenced a significant impact on the overall energy demand of the case study analyzed.},

An oft-cited piece of information in this debate is the genome sequence of a bat coronavirus strain referred to as RaTG13 1 mentioned in a recent Nature paper 2 showing 96.2\% genome homology with SARS-CoV-2. This is discussed as a fossil record of a strain whose current existence is unknown. The said strain is conjectured by many to have been part of the ancestral pool from which SARS-CoV-2 may have evolved 7, 8, 9. Multiple groups have been discussing the features of the genome sequence of the said strain. In this paper, we report that the currently specified level of details are grossly insufficient to draw inferences about the origin of SARS-CoV-2. De-novo assembly, KRONA analysis for metagenomic and re-examining data quality highlights the key issues with the RaTG13 genome and the need for a dispassionate review of this data.

Residential environments are facing challenges to achieve their liveability due to lack of resources, population growth, and urbanization. Over the past decades, a considerable progress has been made towards the evaluation of the quality of urban development and buildings and it mainly addresses environmental indicators. The main objective of this research is the development of a new methodology for assessing the quality of residential environment design in urban areas and to emphasize the significance of the holistic approach based on Scandinavian experience. The Scandinavian role model for housing issues not only comprises of building design, but also provides a development of high-quality residential environment as a whole to improve social well-being. An innovative deductive methodology serves as a platform for developing a system of criteria and quantitative and qualitative indicators for assessing the quality of residential environment while ensuring healthy, pleasant, and attractive environments for living. The REL method is discussed from many different aspects, while the indicators refer to various elements of physical urban form in residential environment. The results of the research show that the criteria system to assess residential environment quality, which focuses on liveability, is of general application.},

Nevertheless, the actual mechanisms that will prove adequate to tackle complex planning issues are still under debate. Considering that in today's so-called era of the Anthropocene such planning issues are more present and evident than ever, the need for further investigating the implications of complexity sciences into building planning approaches becomes very relevant. In this article, we use the concept of complex systems as an analytical framework challenging our understanding of planning and we argue in favour of a `complexity turn' in planning through the adaptive rationale. We define the adaptive rationale as an additional, both normative and analytical, trajectory in planning theory, in the interplay between certainty and uncertainty. Finally, to assimilate this rationale into planning mechanisms capable to respond to contemporary social and ecological challenges, we call for issue-driven adaptive planning approaches conceptualized through normative sustainability and nourished by post-normal science.},

More precisely, it applies property rights analysis to the methodology of nomocracy, a leading branch of the theory of complexity in planning. To study the methodology of planning, the paper focuses on its objectives and methods, as well as the characteristics of nomocratic rules. It briefly examines the literature on the methods of planning of complex systems, the methods of the nomocratic approach, and the methods of regulation theory. It then develops a theoretical structure of the methodology of nomocratic planning by employing property rights analysis and finds that the purpose of nomocracy is the allocation of entitlements. Finally, to emphasise the importance of property rights, it discusses some specific findings of Holcombe's work ``Planning and the Invisible Hand''. Holcombe's work is a well-developed study of the relevance of the nomocratic approach to market functions; planning practices, such as zoning; and topical issues of contemporary urban development, such as sprawl and related new urbanism/smart growth principles. This paper focuses on Holcombe's particularly critical view of the latter. However, while the application of property rights analysis fully supports Holcombe's understanding of the positive connection between nomocratic planning and the market, it also leads to a more favourable view of zoning and new urbanist principles. The paper concludes that the main objective and defining characteristic of nomocratic rules is that they serve to allocate property rights over commonly owned resources.},

  abstract = {Community quality is an extremely complex concept which involves the physical environment providing opportunities for humans to meet their needs and desires. Both researchers and designers must concern themselves with raising the standard of the designed environment from the present level, to one which successfully meets the complex levels of human needs. To reach this goal, it is necessary to bridge the gap between research and design and to link the two into a comprehensive framework. This research project is an investigation of the physical elements that contribute to the quality of a community. A quality community is one which meets the needs and desires of its visitors and inhabitants. The methods involve descriptive research, matrix development and case study applications. Six categories and 28 sub-categories of community quality and needs criteria were developed through the research of community quality, and human social and psychological needs theories. The six main categories of the quality principles are livability, character, connection, mobility, personal freedom, and diversity. Approximately, two hundred community physical form criteria were developed through the summary of professional community design literature and guidelines. The physical form criteria were categorized under community, urban block, buildings, streets, pedestrian ways, open space, vegetation, and feature areas. A matrix relating social needs with physical form, illustrates how community quality can be better understood through physical design. Case study applications of three communities in Toronto, the Beaches, High Park, and Parkdale, illustrate how the matrices can be used to analyze a community. The result is a framework for understanding the relationship between the quality of an urban environment and physical form. Matrix analysis showed that connection and character scored the highest with respect to physical form, and the top physical form criteria are, a walkable community, outdoor amenities, lots of seating, barrier free, and open space areas in residential areas. 0 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Changes are needed to make a city such as Adelaide less car-dependent toward a city that relies on more sustainable transport modes for its day to day urban travel needs. This paper presents the results from a comparative study of travel patterns among residents of four suburban residential areas in metropolitan Adelaide. Using existing datasets together with inventory data of urban environment characteristics from original fieldwork, this paper examines to what extent there are associations between various attributes of a particular urban location as they relate to travel behavior and household socio-economics. The findings derived from multinomial logit models show that suburban development pattern and design attributes can potentially create shifts in transport modal split suggesting that microscale urban features should be given more attention in transport policy making.},

  abstract = {A range of applications, from predicting the spread of human and electronic viruses to city planning and resource management in mobile communications, depend on our ability to foresee the whereabouts and mobility of individuals, raising a fundamental question: To what degree is human behavior predictable? Here we explore the limits of predictability in human dynamics by studying the mobility patterns of anonymized mobile phone users. By measuring the entropy of each individual's trajectory, we find a 93\% potential predictability in user mobility across the whole user base. Despite the significant differences in the travel patterns, we find a remarkable lack of variability in predictability, which is largely independent of the distance users cover on a regular basis. Analysis of the trajectories of people carrying cell phones reveals that human mobility patterns are highly predictable.

  abstract = {This paper aims to describe a natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning-based approach for supporting automated rule checking system. Automated rule checking has been developed in various ways and enhanced the efficiency of building design review process. Converting human-readable building regulations to computer-readable format is, however, still time-consuming and error-prone due to the nature of human languages. Several domain-independent efforts have been made for NLP, and this paper focuses on how computers can be able to understand semantic meaning of building regulations to intelligently automate rule interpretation process. This paper proposes a semantic analysis process of regulatory sentences and its utilization for rule checking system. The proposed process is composed of following steps: 1) learning semantics of words and sentences, 2) utilization of semantic analysis. For semantic analysis, we use word embedding technique which converts meaning of words in numerical values. By using those values, computers can extract related words and classify the topic of sentences. The results of the semantic analysis can elaborate the interpretation with domain-specific knowledge. This paper also shows a demonstration of the proposed approach.},

Two similar questionnaires from 2001 and 2004 reveal that citizens in some dense inner city districts experience higher green space accessibility than citizens in some low-density `green' suburbs in Stockholm. This peculiar result was the starting point of testing old and new measures in 10 different city districts using a new GIS-application `The Place Syntax Tool' (PST). PST makes it possible to calculate the open space accessibility from every address point in an urban area. A new measure, which considers range (1000 m), orientation (axial line distance), green space size (sqm) and number of use values, correlated considerably better to the questionnaires (R2=0.74, P{$<$}0.001) than any of the conventional measures. Correlation was also found when comparing another questionnaire that asked participants how often they go to their favorite green area and axial line accessibility to green areas (R2=0.77, P=0.018). Consequently, cognitive anthropocentric measures of accessibility and attraction can change the common opinion of open space and `green' from a static to a dynamic urban entity.},

  abstract = {The shift from Axial to Line-segment maps is one of the most important developments in Space Syntax analysis, both theoretically and methodologically. It followed a long line of investigations and discussions within the field of Space Syntax, which addressed critical issues related to the Axial map representation (e.g. Hillier and Iida,2005; Hillier,1999a,1999b; Turner,2001; Steadman,2004, Dalton, 2001). At the same time, it opened up new possibilities by allowing for the use of Road-centre-line maps in Space Syntax analysis; that is, largely available GIS-based segment maps, used in most areas of urban modelling (e.g. Turner,2007; Dalton et al.,2003). Today, several models implement syntactical analysis to Road-centre-line maps, while claiming to form valid alternatives to the Axial map, not least in capturing the perceptual and cognitive affordances presented by the environment. This paper focuses on such alternative models with a twofold aim: first, to help make well-grounded choices in applying syntactical analysis to Road-centre-line maps; and second, to explore the methodological potentials of Line-segment maps, which are created by their flexibility, by being the least aggregated representations of street networks. The paper introduces an experimental software application to push the investigations and exploit these methodological possibilities even further. The models discussed in this paper are: 1) Angular Segment Analysis (e.g. Turner,2007; Hillier and Iida,2005); 2) Natural Streets maps (Jiang and Liu,2007) and Continuity maps (Figueiredo and Amorim,2005); 3) Directional Distance model (Peponis et al.,2008). Based on a systematic comparison of: a) their geometric representation of the street network (the `map'), b) the dual-graph they calculate, and c) the measure of distance they use, we argue that they can all be seen as parametrically defined representations, based on a Line-segment map. In other words, with the same Line-segment map one could produce all of them, if a different set of angular parameters was used, to either define the graph elements (nodes, edges), or to calculate distance. These models, parametrically redefine the relation between the `map' and the `graph'; thus, challenging the one-to-one relation between the two, that the Axial map was founded upon. The methodological importance of this development goes beyond the specific models described in this paper. If the same Line-segment map can produce different graphs by using a different set of angular parameters, then, for instance, one could easily change the parameters to follow the latest theoretical insights on human cognition, without having to change the map. Going even further, one could develop and test different representational models to explore new theoretical and methodological paths, by using one single map. The experimental tool also presented in this paper is a step in that direction, allowing to test different models using a single software.},

However, its optimal measurement has remained a major concern worldwide. In recent decades, methodological development and researches on housing affordability measurement approaches (HAMA) have accelerated and continue to grow exponentially. Despite this intensive global development, very few attempts have been made to present the theoretical bases and track the developmental trends of these approaches. Thus, this study attempts to fill this literature gap and extend prior studies by exploring several alternatives of HAMA; with a focus on their methodological weaknesses. This paper highlights three emerging novel methodologies, which complement the relative strength of the conventional approaches. Findings suggest that the main research evidence which summarizes the weaknesses in the conventional measures is; their inability to incorporate sustainability features and over reliance on economic dimension. While the complexity of emerging methodologies, though deepen the overall understanding of multiple concerns that breed HA problems. But are less transparent, more data intensive, and their computation is very demanding, with a high tendency that their complex nature could weaken their uptake by researchers. This study raises concern over the nearly sole reliance on the conventional approaches in the reformations of policy instrument, despite their overwhelming weaknesses. It reiterates the need for reconsideration and offers new insight, but not conclusive information on better ways to conceptualize and measure HA.},

This paper proposes a mobility choices model based on urban form and accessibility factors commonly used in urban planning and design practices. The mobility choices model produces heat maps and visually informs about the integration with walking, cycling, public transportation and private car, modal shares, carbon emissions and transportation energy use. This information can (potentially) trigger urban transformation or redesign to better integrate sustainable travel alternatives in these neighbourhoods and contribute to more sustainable cities. Many houses can have an excellent environmental performance as buildings but they can be located at a distance where it is impossible to walk, cycle or use public transportation. The benefits of energy efficient and carbon neutral home then disappears with extensive travel and commuting by automobile.\textbackslash textless/p\textbackslash textgreater},

Nonetheless, the problem-solving capacity of the regional planning level is still questioned by both academics and practitioners. This paper studies the tension between formal and informal regional governance and its practical challenges for two cases of Dutch provinces struggling with their position in regional governance networks. These cases entail pan-European development (Trans-European Transport Networks \textendash{} TEN-T) and regional land development (Bloemendalerpolder). It was found that at the metropolitan scale, formal regional planning powers tend to overrule socially produced regional governance arrangements. Simultaneously, regional planning powers lack support of these socially produced arrangements for their interventions. At the same time, at the supra-regional scale, provinces are a logical stakeholder to fulfil a prominent role in regional governance, but often lack the institutional capacity to act as such. We therefore argue that regional planning authorities need to be granted the power and capacity to take up a more centripetal, intermediate role in governance arrangements. This would provide them more capacity to act in disentangling the difficult practical challenges of scalar problems that many regional governance arrangements currently face.},

  abstract = {Urban structures, developed and grown over a period of time, are created by processes that, due to the number of influential factors, are not longer comprehensible as a whole. Their development is very complex and depends on a big number of reciprocal factors that even architects or planners sometimes cannot recognize the formal, functional and rational processes of thinking behind it. The involved mechanisms however are particularly obvious in historical urban structures that came to exist over a period of centuries. The planned relationships within these conglomerates are governed by nearly indiscernible rules and show similarities in form and shape to living and non-living forms in nature. They are clearly analogous to fractals or systems with chaotic behavior. In the course of the research project ``media experimental design'', financed by the German Research Foundation, algorithms are sought that are able to simulate urban analogous structures digitally. To this effect the main rules of growth processes are researched and extracted. Then, by following these rules, virtual structures are developed and shown by using powerful three-dimensional techniques. The developed mechanisms allow urban planning to be process-oriented, interactive and flexible for permanently changing parameters. With an implemented set of rules the computer is able to create a design and to react to changing situations. In several experimental studies structures were successfully generated which have different forms and qualities depending on their set of rules. For example, structures were programmed which are similar to a big city while other look like a village in hilly landscape. Diverse rules and strategies have been used in order to reduce them to shape specific factors. The rules for growth are administered by a specifically developed databank with sophisticated search mechanisms using the Issue-Concept- Form tool as case-based-reasoning method.},

  abstract = {Cities play an important role in the global carbon cycle. They produce a large proportion of CO2 emissions, but they also sequester and store carbon in urban forests and green space. However, sequestration by urban green space is difficult to quantify and also involves emissions. The carbon footprint analysis is an established method for systematically quantifying carbon sinks and sources throughout the lifetime of goods and services. We applied this method to an urban green space project in Leipzig, Germany. To the best of our knowledge it is the first application in this field. We simulated carbon sequestration by growing trees and contrasted it with all related carbon sources, from construction and maintenance over the lifetime of 50 years. In addition, we explored alternative design and maintenance scenarios. Total net sequestration was predicted to be between 137 and 162 MgCO2 ha-1. Park-like design and maintenance is less effective than forest-like design and maintenance. Much uncertainty is linked to tree growth and tree mortality. Increasing annual tree mortality from 0.5 to 4\% reduces sequestration by over 70\%. In conclusion, urban green space can act as a carbon sink and the design and maintenance have a strong influence on the carbon footprint. The carbon footprint analysis is a valuable tool for estimating the longterm environmental performance of urban green space projects. Compared to emissions from people, the overall potential for carbon mitigation is limited, even in cities such as Leipzig with widely available space for new urban green space.},

  abstract = {Commuting is the major source of congestion and air pollution in the United States. For almost a decade, urban policy-makers have been concerned about the geographical balance between locations of jobs and housing as a strategy for reducing traffic congestion and air pollution in American cities. Despite the popularity and apparent acceptance of the job/housing (J/H) imbalance concept among public policy-makers, little empirical research has been done on the J/H imbalance and how it relates to commuting patterns. This research examines commuting patterns in the Atlanta metropolitan area to determine the extent to which commuting flow volume is the result of an imbalance between the location of home and workplace by using the most sophisticated and largest geographical scale data provided by the 1990 U.S. Census of Transportation Planning Package. This paper uses a Geographic Information System (GIS) to measure the job/housing imbalance within a commuting catchment area having a 7-mile radius from the centroid of each Transportation Analysis Zone. Analysis of variance, stepwise multiple regression and cartographic evidence all confirm the relationship between the imbalance of jobs and housing (J/H) and mean travel time to work. This investigation highlights the fact that the imbalance between the location of jobs and housing is the most important determinant for longer commuting and suggests that higher quality housing growth close to the job-rich communities may benefit the workers to economize the commuting time.},

Cells are `genetically identical' with full development potential and can simultaneously lay roads and residential lots, using the gene set to change cell expression and adapt to local contexts. Cells can be seen as self-propagating agents that sort out their dependencies through local interactions. When COmputational Urban Layout Design is set to grow a non-orthogonal layout, the plan has winding roads and irregular residential lots. Such a plan achieves the objective of relatively high residential density and accessibility, leading to walkable and coherent communities.},

So far, 60 million people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, and 1.4 million people have died because of COVID-19 worldwide, causing serious health, economical, and sociological problems. However, the mechanism of the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on human host cells has not been defined. The present study reports that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alone without the rest of the viral components is sufficient to elicit cell signaling in lung vascular cells. The treatment of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells or human pulmonary artery endothelial cells with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit (Val16 \textendash{} Gln690) at 10~ng/ml (0.13~nM) caused an activation of MEK phosphorylation. The activation kinetics was transient with a peak at 10~min. The recombinant protein that contains only the ACE2 receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit (Arg319 \textendash{} Phe541), on the other hand, did not cause this activation. Consistent with the activation of cell growth signaling in lung vascular cells by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, pulmonary vascular walls were found to be thickened in COVID-19 patients. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated cell growth signaling may participate in adverse cardiovascular/pulmonary outcomes, and this mechanism may provide new therapeutic targets to combat COVID-19.,                         Unlabelled Image},

  abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has killed nearly one million people so far. While this is a respiratory virus, surprisingly, it has been recognized that patients with cardiovascular disease are likely to be affected severely and die of COVID-19. This phenomenon cannot be explained by the generally accepted logic that the SARS-CoV-2 infection/replication is the sole determinant of the actions of the virus to define the fate of host cells. I herein propose the viral protein fragment theory of COVID-19 pathogenesis based on my observations in cultured human vascular cells that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can activate cell signaling events without the rest of the viral components. It is generally thought that SARS-CoV-2 and other single-stranded RNA viruses attach to the host cells through the interactions between surface proteins of the viral capsid and the host cell receptors; the fusion and the entry of the viral components, resulting in the replication of the viruses; and the host cell responses are the consequence of these events. I hypothesize that, as humans are infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus releases (a) fragment(s) of the spike protein that can target host cells for eliciting cell signaling without the rest of the viral components. Thus, COVID-19 patients are subjected to the intact virus infecting the host cells for the replication and amplification as well as the spike protein fragments that are capable of affecting the host cells. I propose that cell signaling elicited by the spike protein fragments that occur in cardiovascular cells would predispose infected individuals to develop complications that are seen in severe and fatal COVID-19 conditions. If this hypothesis is correct, then the strategies to treat COVID-19 should include, in addition to agents that inhibit the viral replication, therapeutics that inhibit the viral protein fragment-mediated cardiovascular cell signaling.},

Three common models are monocentricity, polycentricity, and dispersion, but these are not always mutually exclusive in the complex spatial structures of contemporary city-regions. Shifts between these models are discussed in the context of three explanations of economic growth and restructuring: accessibility, municipal competition, and globalization. All three explanations suggest a trend away from monocentricity. While this appears clearly in US cities, disagreement surrounds whether Canadian cities are following the same path. This study uses cross-sectional data from InfoGroup in 2011 to estimate the relative strengths of monocentricity, polycentricity, and dispersion for characterizing eight major regions. Results indicate that elements of each model are evident in all eight study regions, but each tends to dominate in different contexts. When focusing on Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver, results imply that all three forces which guide spatial structure play a role and that job centers appear to play a particularly important structural role in larger regions.},

We can then see clearly how a very few core nodes dominate this network, there are approximately 200 countries in the world but these 19 largest jurisdictions in terms of capital together are responsible for over 90\% of the assets. This type of  centralized structure to a network is surprisingly reverent in our world and we could cite many other examples of it, such as social networks where a very few people may have millions of people connected to them and the vast majority very few. These highly centralized networks are more formally called scale free or power law networks, that describe a power or exponential relationship between the degree of connectivity a node has and the frequency of its occurrence. These power law networks are really define by the mathematics that is behind them so lets just take a quick look at that it. In these networks, The number of nodes with degree x is proportional to 1 over x squared So, The number of nodes with degree 2 is one fourth of all the nodes The number of nodes with degree 3 is one ninth of the nodes The number of nodes with degree 10 is proportional to one hundredth If we have a network with a thousand nodes of degree one then we would have 250 nodes with degree two, and proximally 31 with degree ten. If we notice then when we go from degree one to degree two we had a very big drop, but then going from degree two to teen the drop is a lot more gradual and this decline continues to get more gradual giving the graph what is called a long tail. The point to take away from this is that this long tail means there can be nodes with a very high degree but there will also be very many with a very low degree of connectivity giving us our centralized network.  This type of power law graph was first discover within the degree distribution of websites on the internet with some websites like Google and Yahoo having very many links into them but there also being very many sites out on the web that have a very few links into them.  Since then it has been discovered in many types of very different networks such as in metabolic networks where the essential molecules of ATP and ADP that provide the energy to fuel cells play a central role interacting with a very many different molecules, where as most of the molecule interaction very few others, thus making these two molecule hubs in the metabolic networks fueling the cells in our bodies.

Transcription: When we hear the word network all sorts of things spring to mind like social networks and the Internet in particular, but the power of network theory is really in its high degree of abstraction, so the first thing for us to do is to try and start back at the beginning by forgetting what we think we know about networks and embrace the abstract language of networks what is called graph theory. In the formal language of mathematics a network is called a graph and graph theory is the area of mathematics that studies these objects called graphs. The first theory of graphs goes back to 1736, the first textbook came about in 1958 but most of the work within this field is less than a few decades old. In its essence a graph is really very simple, it consist of just two parts what are called vertices and edges. Firstly Vertices; a vertex or node is a thing, that is to say it is an entity and we can ascribe some value to it, so a person is an example of a node as is a car, planet, farm, city or molecule. All of these things have static properties that can be quantifies, such as the color of our car, the size of our farm, or the weight of our molecule. Within network science vertices are more often called nodes so we will be typically using this term during the course. Edges can be define as a relation of some sort between two or more nodes, this connection may be tangible as in the cables between computers on a network or the roads between cities within a national transportation system or these edges may by be intangible, such as social relations of friendship. Edges may be also called links, ties or relations and we will be often using this latter term during the course. The nodes belonging to an edge are called the ends, endpoints, or end vertices of the edge. Within graph theory networks are called graphs and a graph is define as a set of edges and a set vertices. A simple graph does not contain loops or multiple edges, but a multigraph is a graph with multiple edges between nodes. So where as a simple graph of a transpiration system would just tell us if there is a connection between two cities, a multigraph would show all the different connections between the two cities. Graphs can be directed or undirected. With an undirected graph edges have no orientation, for example a diplomatic relation between two nations may be mutual and thus have no direction to the edge between the nodes. These undirected graphs have unordered pairs of nodes, that means we can just switch them round, if Jane and Paul are married, we can say Jane is married to Paul or we can say Paul is married to Jane it makes no difference and thus it is an unordered pair.

Transcription excerpt: How something spreads across a network is a key question we will be interested in asking when analyzing many different networks, the classical example of this being the diffusion of a disease through some population, but we might be talking about how the loss of one species in an ecosystem has an effect on others, the spread of financial contagion from one institution to another, or the spread of some information within a group of people. More formally we call this spreading on a network propagation or diffusion, how diffusion happens and how long it takes is defined by a number of different parameters. We will just list the primary factors involved here before looking into them individually. Firstly we have some infectiousness metric, where we are talking about how infectious is the phenomena that is spreading on the network.  A corollary to this is asking how resistant are the nodes to this contagion giving us a resistance parameter.  Next we need to consider the topology to the network, obviously this diffusion is taking place along the connections within the network, meaning different structures to the connections and different degree distribution will be another defining factor when considering diffusion. Lastly we need to consider if this diffusion is taking place strategically or at random and this ties back to topology because as we have already discussed some network topologies are more susceptible to strategic influence then others. So Firstly to discuss infectiousness: By infectiousness we mean something that is likely to spread or influence others in a rapid manner, irrespective of the type of network it is spreading on. If you hear about some important piece of news, you feel driven to tell others and that is infectiousness, it is like an out word force that is pushing the phenomena across local connections and out over the network. We may be able to quantify this in terms of money or how contagious a disease is or a number of other metrics but we also need to ask, how many nodes a given node can infect in any given time interval? A mosquito can only bit one other creature at a time but a person can broadcast a message to possibly millions of other people at any given instance, thus enabling a much more rapid contagion rate. Inversely we need to think about how resistant the nodes in the network are to the spreading of this phenomena.  Imagine trying to promote gay mirage in some conservator rural community, no matter how infectious your campaign is it is unlikely to take off and this is due not to your failures but to the resistant of the other nodes in the network to this phenomena.  We could also add time to our model here, capturing how nodes may be affected for only a brief period of time before recovery, As would be the case with the spread of many diseases or some trend in fashion.

As network theory is a very new subject much of it is still focused on trying to explore the basics of static graphs, as the study of their dynamics results in the additional of a whole new sets of parameters to our models and takes us into a new level of complexity, much of which remains unexplored, and is the subject of active research. Transcription excerpt: So lets start by talking about growing a random network to see what it looks like, when we say growing a network we might mean adding more nodes to it, but also, more interestingly adding links to it, that increases the overall connectivity. In our random model links were just placed between nodes at random with some given probability, growing the network here just meant increasing this probability so as to have more links develop over time. One interesting thing we find when we do this is that there are thresholds and phase transitions during the network's development, by thresholds we simply mean that, by gradually increasing our link probability parameter, some property to the network suddenly appearing when we pass a critical value.  So for example our first threshold is when the average degree goes above 1 over the total number of nodes in the network, as at this threshold we start to get our first connection. At degree one that is when every node has on average one connection the network stars to appear connected, we see one giant component  emerging within the network, that is one dominant cluster and we start to have cycles, which means there are feedback loops in the network. Another threshold occurs when nodes have an average degree of log(n) at this point everything starts to be connected meaning there is typically a path to all other nodes in the network. So this is what we see in random network but as we know most real world networks are not random as they are subject to some resource constraints and they have preferential attachment giving them clusters that we do not see in these random graphs. One way of thinking about how real world networks form is through the lens of percolation theory, percolation theory looks at how something filters all percolates through something else like a liquid filtering through some mash structure in a material or we might think about some water running down the side of the hill, as it does the water will find the path of least resistance creating channels and furrows in the side of the hill. This network formation is then the product of the resource constraints that its environment placed upon it, but the constraints are unevenly distributed and the networks topology is then reflecting this as it follows the paths of least resistance as it avoids toughest material. In order to demonstrate the general relevance of this we will take some other examples, if say we put on a cheap flights from one city to another then people will start using that transportation link because of financial constraints. Or because of phenomena of Homophily within social networks we will get the same peculation dynamic where it will be easier for people to make links with people who are similar to themselves than with others, again creating a particular structure based on the social constraints within the system.

As the name implies network theory is all about the study of networks, we are trying to create models so as to analyze them, in order to be able to do this the first thing we need is some kind of formal language and this formal language is called graph theory. We will be going into the details of graph theory in the next lecture but it is a relatively new area of mathematics that gives us some kind of standardized language with which to talk about and quantify the structure and properties of networks. So once we have this basic vocabulary, say you give me a network to analyze the question then turns to what are the features and properties of this network that we should be really interested. The first set of questions we might like to ask relate to individual elements within the network. We want to know what are the nodes within the network what are the connections between them and what properties are we really interested in, for example in a computer network we might not be interested in who owns the different computers and connections but just interested in the speed of the computers and the bandwidth of the connections, so we need to define what it is about our network we are interested in because as with all models we will be focusing on some information and excluding other. There is lots of other information we want to know about these individual elements and the connections, such as asking whether they are weighted or not, meaning can we ascribe a value to them, we can talk about a computer network's bandwidth in megabits per second, but it might not be so easy to do the same with a social network where the relations are of friendship or kinship. We can also ask if these relations go both ways or are just unidirectional. Other questions we will be asking here is how connected is any individual node or how central is it within the overall network. The next major set of questions we will be asking about our network will relate to its overall structure, networks are defined by both what happens on the local level, that is how central or connected you are, but also what happens on the global level, because the dynamics of the network on the global level feeds back to effect the elements on the local level. Here some of the key questions we will be asking about the overall structure to the network is firstly how connected is it? Are there connections between all the parts or are some parts disconnect and separate from others? How dense is this set of connections? If we compare a group of unassociated people waiting at a bus stop with a close knit group of friends we will see the density of the network will vary greatly. What are the patters of clustering within the system? Do we see many small groups or just a few large groups? These are the types of features that will define the overall makeup of the network structure. One key question we are interested in answering here is if we change some parameter to one of                   Show less                   Show more},

Although most researchers are still drawn to her writings on urban spaces and their human interactions, a few have begun to discuss her economic insights, and others yet have published comprehensive biographies. Interest in the inductive methodology Jacobs used to generate her ideas, and in the organized complexity paradigm that shaped her work and worldview, however, has been sparse because of their apparent lack of scientific rigour. This paper, the second of two connected works in which we explore both the development and the full fruition of Jacobs as spontaneous economic order theorist and methodologist, discusses her use of metaphor and inductive methods as tools firmly in, and of, the current philosophical understanding of acceptable research methods in the social sciences. In addition to positioning Jacobs' methods within the realm of the philosophy of science, we also examine her research strategies and discuss the critical reception of the theoretical and methodological aspects of her work.},

The article begins with a review of the principle of social mixing\textemdash specifically income mix\textemdash and how it is linked to physical planning and design. An assessment is made of the ways in which planning and design are enlisted in the effort to produce and support social mix, focusing especially on the goal of ``affordability by design.'' The article next reviews the empirical record, and assesses whether there is evidence that New Urbanist developments are capable of accommodating income mix and promoting economic diversity. Data for 152 New Urbanist projects were obtained, and it was found that 23 out of 152 developments or 15\% were affordable to someone making the Area Median Income. The evidence suggests that while design-based approaches to diversity in New Urbanism are within the realm of possibilities, the supply of developers willing to pursue a multi-pronged strategy composed of good location, creative financing, innovation, government support, and self-determination is necessarily limited. Finally, a framework is offered to help planners and New Urbanists conceptualize the problem of affordability in walkable neighborhoods and determine future courses of action.},

Studies conclude that crime does not occur uniformly across urban landscapes but concen\- trates in certain areas. This phenomenon has drawn attention to spatial crime analysis, primarily focusing on crime hotspots, areas with disproportionally higher crime density. In this paper we present CRIMETRACER, a personalized random walk based approach to spatial crime analysis and crime location prediction outside of hotspots. We propose a probabilistic model of spatial behavior of known ofl'enders within their activity space. Crime Pattern Theory concludes that offenders, rather than venture into unknown territory, frequently commit opportunistic crimes and serial violent crimes by taking advantage of opportunities they encounter in places they are most familiar with as part of their activity space. Our experiments on a large real-world crime dataset show that CRIMETRACER outperforms all other methods used for location recommendation we evaluate here.},

  abstract = {Drawing upon Flyvbjerg's (1998) insight that planning is defined more by the political than the rational, we examine the experience of parking reform, as attempted by municipal officials, in Vancouver, British Columbia. The literature offers a broad consensus that minimum parking requirements represent a misguided and inefficient policy producing excess parking in the wrong places and reduced housing affordability. Yet minimum parking requirements remain a near-universal fixture in municipal regulations. We examine the stubborn disconnect between Vancouver's parking standards and its strategic policies. Rather than reiterating normative debates, we consider how ideas and institutions could shape officials' hesitation in reform. We reveal the compromise that ensues under planning's duality of designing credible, forward-looking strategy while managing the political constraints created by policy path dependence. We find that Vancouver's laneway housing parking requirement represents a typology that could propagate across North America: a transitional parking requirement of political compromise, which, we suggest, has the potential to produce a workable reconciliation of theory and practice.},

  abstract = {The proportion of tenants will undoubtedly rise in Poland, where at present, the ownership housing model is very dominant. As a result, the rental housing market in Poland is currently under-researched in comparison with owner-occupancy. In order to narrow this research gap, this study attempts to identify the determinants affecting rental prices in Cracow. The latter were obtained from the internet platform otodom.pl using the web scraping technique. To identify rent determinants, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and spatial econometric methods were used. In particular, traditional spatial autoregressive model (SAR) and spatial autoregressive geographically weighted regression (GWR-SAR) were employed, which made it possible to take into account the spatial heterogeneity of the parameters of determinants and the spatially changing spatial autocorrelation of housing rents. In-depth analysis of rent determinants using the GWR-SAR model exposed the complexity of the rental market in Cracow. Estimates of the above model revealed that many local markets can be identified in Cracow, with different factors shaping housing rents. However, one can identify some determinants that are ubiquitous for almost the entire city. This concerns mainly the variables describing the area of the flat and the age of the building. Moreover, the Monte Carlo test indicated that the spatial autoregressive parameter also changes significantly over space.},

Based on a morphological analysis of 77 towns in northern and central Israel, and an in-depth investigation conducted in the city of Sakhnin, in the central Galilee, the paper reveals a repeated three-ring structure, corresponding to three socio-political periods. We offer a detailed examination of the links between social values and spatial conduct, thus enabling us to follow how slight changes in social and economic circumstances affect planning principles. In addition, the paper highlights the power of planning-without-a-plan as a method that facilitates shaping the quality of the built environment while allowing local adaptation and creativity. Finally, we discuss the problematic urban pattern created in the typical third ring, which is a top-to-bottom product of modern planning thought.},

  abstract = {There has been renewed interest in sociotechnical systems in the context of transitioning to a more sustainable society. While gains have been made in the qualitative understanding of sustainable transitions and sociotechnical systems, these approaches have not been well-operationalized. Given the importance of meeting future energy and environmental policy targets, there is need to develop predictive techniques and more robust methods to quantify and analyze sociotechnical systems undergoing rapid change and uncertainty due to sustainability pressures. Sustainability transitions depend on large-scale diffusion of technological and behavioral innovations on physical and virtual networked systems. Transitions can therefore be viewed as a subclass of diffusion phenomenon and subject to a range of mathematical and computational methods. We review, categorize, and critically assess methodological and theoretical approaches that integrate different aspects of sustainability, innovation, and complexity. We argue that these approaches should be adapted to improve our understanding of the behavior and dynamics of a broad range of sociotechnical systems to meet sustainability objectives. We therefore also make the conceptual link between complexity and sustainability as complimentary fields of research to inform policy and decision making to achieve more sustainable outcomes. \textcopyright{} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

There is an increase in net radiation absorbed, but not in ways commonly assumed. While there is a large increase in the greenhouse effect from increasing greenhouse gases and water vapor (as a feedback), this is offset to a large degree by a decreasing greenhouse effect from reducing cloud cover and increasing radiative emissions from higher temperatures. Instead the main warming from an energy budget standpoint comes from increases in absorbed solar radiation that stem directly from the decreasing cloud amounts. These findings underscore the need to ascertain the credibility of the model changes, especially insofar as changes in clouds are concerned.},

  abstract = {Public goods in the United States are largely funded and delivered at the local level. Local public goods are valuable, but their production requires overcoming several collective action problems including coordinating supply and minimizing congestion, free-riding, and peer effects. Land use regulations, promulgated by local governments, allow communities to solve the collective action problems inherent in the provision of local public goods and maintenance of property values. A consequence of these efforts is residential segregation between cities along racial lines. I provide evidence that more stringent land use regulations are supported by whiter communities and that they preserve racial homogeneity. First, I show that cities that were whiter than their metropolitan area in 1970 are more likely to have restrictive land use patterns in 2006. Then, relying on Federal Fair Housing Act lawsuits to generate changes in land use policy, I show that restrictive land use helps to explain metropolitan area segregation patterns over time. Finally, I draw on precinct level initiative elections from several California cities to show that whiter neighborhoods are more supportive of restricting development. These results strongly suggest that even facially race-neutral land use policies have contributed to racial segregation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in China in 2002 and spread to other countries before brought under control. Because of a concern for reemergence or a deliberate release of the SARS coronavirus, vaccine development was initiated. Evaluations of an inactivated whole virus vaccine in ferrets and nonhuman primates and a virus-like-particle vaccine in mice induced protection against infection but challenged animals exhibited an immunopathologic-type lung disease. DESIGN: Four candidate vaccines for humans with or without alum adjuvant were evaluated in a mouse model of SARS, a VLP vaccine, the vaccine given to ferrets and NHP, another whole virus vaccine and an rDNA-produced S protein. Balb/c or C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated i.m. on day 0 and 28 and sacrificed for serum antibody measurements or challenged with live virus on day 56. On day 58, challenged mice were sacrificed and lungs obtained for virus and histopathology. RESULTS: All vaccines induced serum neutralizing antibody with increasing dosages and/or alum significantly increasing responses. Significant reductions of SARS-CoV two days after challenge was seen for all vaccines and prior live SARS-CoV. All mice exhibited histopathologic changes in lungs two days after challenge including all animals vaccinated (Balb/C and C57BL/6) or given live virus, influenza vaccine, or PBS suggesting infection occurred in all. Histopathology seen in animals given one of the SARS-CoV vaccines was uniformly a Th2-type immunopathology with prominent eosinophil infiltration, confirmed with special eosinophil stains. The pathologic changes seen in all control groups lacked the eosinophil prominence. CONCLUSIONS: These SARS-CoV vaccines all induced antibody and protection against infection with SARS-CoV. However, challenge of mice given any of the vaccines led to occurrence of Th2-type immunopathology suggesting hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV components was induced. Caution in proceeding to application of a SARS-CoV vaccine in humans is indicated.},

  abstract = {The fewest-line axial map, often simply referred to as the 'axial map', is one of the primary tools of space syntax. Its natural language definition has allowed researchers to draw consistent maps that present a concise description of architectural space; it has been established that graph measures obtained from the map are useful for the analysis of pedestrian movement patterns and activities related to such movement: for example, the location of services or of crime. However, the definition has proved difficult to translate into formal language by mathematicians and algorithmic implementers alike. This has meant that space syntax has been criticised for a lack of rigour in the definition of one of its fundamental representations. Here we clarify the original definition of the fewest-line axial map and show that it can be implemented algorithmically. We show that the original definition leads to maps similar to those currently drawn by hand, and we demonstrate that the differences between the two may be accounted for in terms of the detail of the algorithm used. We propose that the analytical power of the axial map in empirical studies derives from the efficient representation of key properties of the spatial configuration that it captures.},

  abstract = {Axial analysis is one of the fundamental components of space syntax. The space syntax community has suggested that it picks up qualities of configurational relationships between spaces not illuminated by other representations. However, critics have questioned the absolute necessity of axial lines to space syntax, as well as the exact definition of axial lines. Why not another representation? In particular, why not road-centre lines, which are easily available in many countries for use within geographical information systems? Here I propose that a recently introduced method of analysis, angular segment analysis, can marry axial and road-centre line representations, and in doing so reflect a cognitive model of how route choice decisions may be made. I show that angular segment analysis can be applied generally to road-centre line segments or axial segments, through a simple length-weighted normalisation procedure that makes values between the two maps comparable. I make comparative quantitative assessments for a real urban system, not just investigating angular analysis between axial and road-centre line networks, but also including more intuitive measures based on metric (or block) distances between locations. I show that the new angular segment analysis algorithm produces better correlation with observed vehicular flow than both standard axial analysis and metric distance measures. The results imply that there is no reason why space syntax inspired measures cannot be combined with transportation network analysis representations in order to create a new, cognitively coherent, model of movement in the city.},

The program allows a user to import a 2D layout in drawing exchange format (DXF), and to fill the open spaces of this layout with a grid of points. The user may then use the program to make a visibility graph representing the visible connections between those point locations. Once the graph has been constructed the user may perform various analyses of the graph, concentrating on those which have previously been found to be useful for spatial description and movement forecasting within the Space Syntax literature. Some measures which have not received so much mainstream attention have also been implemented. In addition to graph analysis, a few sundry tools are also enabled so that the user may make minor adjustments to the graph. Depthmap has been implemented for the Windows 95/98/NT and 2000 platforms.},

  abstract = {Gibson's ecological theory of perception has received considerable attention within psychology literature, as well as in computer vision and robotics. However, few have applied Gibson's approach to agent-based models of human movement, because the ecological theory requires that individuals have a vision-based mental model of the world, and for large numbers of agents this becomes extremely expensive computationally. Thus, within current pedestrian models, path evaluation is based on calibration from observed data or on sophisticated but deterministic route-choice mechanisms; there is little open-ended behavioural modelling of human-movement patterns. One solution which allows individuals rapid concurrent access to the visual information within an environment is an `exosomatic visual architecture', where the connections between mutually visible locations within a configuration are prestored in a lookup table. Here we demonstrate that, with the aid of an exosomatic visual architecture, it is possible to develop behavioural models in which movement rules originating from Gibson's principle of affordance are utilised. We apply large numbers of agents programmed with these rules to a built-environment example and show that, by varying parameters such as destination selection, field of view, and steps taken between decision points, it is possible to generate aggregate movement levels very similar to those found in an actual building context.},

Using the visibility graph, we can extend both isovist and current graph-based analyses of architectural space to form a new methodology for the investigation of configurational relationships. The measurement of local and global characteristics of the graph, for each vertex or for the system as a whole, is of interest from an architectural perspective, allowing us to describe a configuration with reference to accessibility and visibility, to compare from location to location within a system, and to compare systems with different geometries. Finally we show that visibility graph properties may be closely related to manifestations of spatial perception, such as way-finding, movement, and space use.},

  abstract = {In this paper we discuss the benefits derived by combining parametric modeling and genetic algorithms to achieve a performance oriented process in design, with specific focus on architectural design. The key role played by geometry in architecture is discussed in relation to performance oriented design, in which evaluations based on engineering criteria are integrated into the conceptual phase of the design. The performance attained by a specific geometric solution is considered along with its complexity in an interdisciplinarity process. A specific case study using large roofs is presented as an example. Enabling the designer to automatically generate a large range of alternative design solutions is a great advantage offered by parametric modeling in supporting geometric design explorations. However, this in turn presents the difficulty of how to evaluate the resulting myriad of generated alternatives. ParaGen is presented as a tool to support the exploration of the parametric design alternatives. ParaGen combines parametric modeling, performance simulation software and genetic algorithms, together with a database to store and retrieve the solutions for subsequent exploration. The design exploration is enhanced by means of the interaction of the designer with the process. This serves two objectives. Firstly, it addresses the genetic algorithm based creation of design solutions, while still focusing on a given fitness function. Secondly, it facilitates knowledge extraction from the generated solutions. A description of the tool and its possible uses by designers is provided. Applications of this tool are illustrated for both education and research, with specific reference to two examples in the field of modular long span roofs. The first case study has been developed as part of a teaching exercise in which ParaGen is used to explore the morphology of a dome based on structural performance. The second case study is derived from a research project which deals with solar energy transmission, and concerns the solar heat gain and daylight transmittance of a long span roof. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we provide the first evidence of the GCR-induced cloud effect on the East-Asian monsoon during the last geomagnetic reversal transition. Bicentennial-resolution monsoon records from the Chinese Loess Plateau revealed that the summer monsoon (SM) was affected by millennial-scale climate events that occurred before and after the reversal, and that the winter monsoon (WM) intensified independently of SM variations; dust accumulation rates increased, coinciding with a cooling event in Osaka Bay. The WM intensification event lasted about 5000 years across an SM peak, during which the Earth's magnetic dipole field weakened to {$<$}25\% of its present strength and the GCR flux increased by more than 50\%. Thus, the WM intensification likely resulted from the increased land\textendash ocean temperature gradient originating with the strong Siberian High that resulted from the umbrella effect of increased low-cloud cover through an increase in GCR flux.},

Although GAN algorithm evaluation methods are accepted in the literature, it is still a question to be answered whether GAN evaluation methods can be used for evaluating the outputs of GAN training with a data set consisting of architectural plan schemes. Throughout this study, the architectural plan scheme outputs of GAN algorithm are evaluated. While making this evaluation, Frechet Inception Distance and Rapid Scene Classification were used, respectively, among the quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods accepted in the literature of the GAN algorithm. As a result of the evaluation, the suitability of these methods for the evaluation of autonomous architectural plan generation was discussed. At the end of the text, it is concluded that quantitative and qualitative GAN evaluation methods need new specialized methods to evaluate architectural plan scheme productions with GAN algorithm.}

The first is a proposal for the concept of sustainable urban liveability that includes the need to meet a minimum number of environmental conditions in terms of resource consumption and the deterioration of the environment. The second contribution is the use of a non-compensatory aggregation technique in order to construct the composite index. This kind of aggregation technique does not allow trade-offs between partial indicators. In the particular context of sustainable urban liveability, it prevents poor performance by the natural environment indicators from being compensated by positive results in the remaining indicators. The proposed composite index for sustainable urban liveability is applied to the case of 58 Spanish cities. The results reveal significant differences in the degree of sustainable urban liveability for this group of cities, but more importantly, they highlight the potential of this proposal for urban management.},

An altered trias energetica as proposed in earlier publications appears to remain a robust concept for low exergy, renewable energy based urban design. When considering sustainable development, environmental assessments shall be completed by an inquiry of the socio-cultural, economical, juridical, aesthetical and ethical aspects characterizing the planning or decision process. The article then presents a number of practical design principles that can help envisioning a built environment that can be sustained on the basis of renewable energy sources.

To investigate whether neighborhood walkability (higher residential density, land use mix, street connectivity) is positively associated with physical activity in Belgian adults and whether this association is moderated by neighborhood SES. Methods. The Belgian Environmental Physical Activity Study (BEPAS) was conducted in Ghent, Belgium. Data were collected between May 2007 and September 2008. Twenty-four neighborhoods were selected, stratified on GIS-based walkability and neighborhood SES. In total, 1200 adults (aged 20\textendash 65 years; 50 per neighborhood) completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and wore an accelerometer for seven days. After omitting participants with missing accelerometer data, the final sample consisted of 1166 adults. Results. Living in a high-walkable neighborhood was associated with more accelerometer-based minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (38.6 vs. 31.8 min/day, p b 0.001), transportational walking and cycling, recreational walking, and less motorized transport (all p b 0.05). Low neighborhood SES was related to more cycling for transport and less motorized transport (all p b 0.05). No interactions between walkability and neighborhood SES were found. Conclusions. The BEPAS results generally confirmed the findings from Australia and the US showing that, in Europe, walkability is also positively related to physical activity. As neighborhood SES was not a significant moderator, walkability appears beneficial for all economic strata.},

Such a framework would allow for a more theory-based choice of indicators and for the development of tools to evaluate multidimensional aspects of urban environmental quality. These tools are required to assess the current and future quality of the urban environment and to have, eventually, the ability to assess the implications of spatial and urban planning policies with respect to these dimensions. Against this background, the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands (RIVM) performed a major literature review [Leidelmeijer, van Kamp, 2002, in press] to identify various concepts in the literature concerning environmental quality, the relationships between these various concepts, as well as their respective theoretical bases. This paper summarises the outcomes of this survey. It reviews the main (types of) concepts of livability, environmental quality, quality of life and sustainability, and presents examples of underlying conceptual models. Different notions and concepts are compared along the dimensions of domain, indicator, scale, time-frame and context as described by [Urban Environmental Quality\textemdash a social geographical perspective, this issue]. It is concluded that a multidisciplinary conceptual framework of environmental quality and quality of life that will go beyond the disciplinary differences found in the current literature is needed if the field is to advance.},

We use the concept of self-organization from complexity theory to examine the relationship between local stakeholders' initiatives and vital urban regeneration processes. We conducted a two case comparative research, Caterham Barracks and Broad Street BID Birmingham (UK), in which local stakeholders take the lead. We analyze the evolution of these regeneration processes by using two different manifestations of self-organization: autopoietic and dissipative selforganization. We found that a balanced interplay between autopoietic and dissipative self-organization of local stakeholders is important for vital urban regeneration processes to establish. We elaborate four explanatory conditions for this interplay. These conditions provide at the one hand stability and identity development, but also the needed connections with established actors and institutions around urban regeneration and flexibility to adjust to evolving demands during the process of regeneration. However, consolidation of such initiatives does mean a challenge for existing structures for government, market and society that will need to adapt and change their roles to new governance realities. In this way self-organizing processes become meaningful in the regeneration of urban areas.},

  abstract = {Change, planned and unplanned, can be the product of events (change by chance), new language (change from societal interaction), and practices (track-bound change), and can involve many different societal actors. To position planning as an activity within this broader context, we present a model that captures the interplay between these three sources of change, leading to a typology of change-inducing phenomena. Change, consequently, can be managed in an active and effective way rather than being viewed as an environment of fuzzy conditions and unpredictable dynamics. Our model may be helpful to planners, as an analytic tool, usable in educational curricula as well as in the practice of planning.},

The aim of this paper is to test the role of polycentricity\textemdash as well as other spatial characteristics, such as compactness, functional diversification and size\textemdash in the costs of commuting, taking into account an external cost component (per-capita CO2 emissions) and a private cost component (time spent on travelling). The degree of urban polycentricity has been measured by adopting a dynamic approach based on commuting flows and on social network analysis tools. The analysis is carried out using a database of 82 Italian metropolitan areas (MAs). Results show that MAs with a higher degree of polycentricity are more virtuous both in terms of private and external costs of mobility, while the degree of compactness is associated with lower environmental costs but with higher private costs. Size is associated with both higher external and private costs, while the role of functional diversification turns out to be statistically insignificant. Socio-demographics also play a role.},

Recent research in both the United States and Canada suggests that residents of the suburbs of large urban regions are more likely to vote for political parties on the right and to support neoliberal policies such as privatization, while the opposite is true for inner-city dwellers. However, the reasons why such a spatial division should occur have received little academic attention. This paper seeks to fill this gap in the literature by analyzing the relationship between residential location, spatial factors, and attitudes toward privatization, using survey data collected in the Toronto region. Results suggest that the way urban space influences residents' daily routines and personal experiences may then mediate their perception of the uses of public services and the efficacy of government spending, factors which are found to affect spatial disparities in support of and/or in opposition to privatization. Thus, there is some evidence that urban spatial form is important for understanding the geographic unevenness of support for neoliberalism, and thus ultimately for the production of ideology.},

The pervasive reach of electronic data and media can help bind the disparate elements of a community together as much as it may seek to disperse them. The process of developing plans, codes and sustainable strategies for a community seeking a truly `smart' future in a competitive world is illustrated by a case study of Beaufort, a medium-sized town in South Carolina, USA, and these efforts highlight the challenges for English towns and cities in the context of the British Government's shift towards `localism' in planning.},

The need for efficient analysis tools and rational design methods represent ongoing concerns, while practicable and maneuverable applications rather than experimental studies are scarce. This research implemented a framework of digital description and generative grammar of block form from the perspective of block morphological complexity. The implemented framework was tested in an urban design practice. First, this study adapted the hierarchical structure and access structure theory to analyze the spatial form of target blocks. The characteristics of blocks case samples in Nanjing are extracted as text descriptions. Second, the relevant composition patterns and parameters were employed as features for classification and were converted into procedural rules. With the top-down control by rules and bottom-up generation by shape grammar in CityEngine, the texture of the block can be generated as close to the actual block as possible. Furthermore, in a real urban design case located in Nanjing, this work applies the method to construct a three-dimensional scene quickly and accurately. After integrating design factors such as an environment, transportation, and vision and summarizing the intentions of blocks and buildings in corresponding functions and control indexes, the initial generation plan was built by applying the obtained characteristics and procedural rules in specific shape grammar. Finally, designers can adjust the result in detail by employing real-time calculation and interactive operation.},

Meanwhile, in the in- dustrial design realm, the aero-dynamics or fluid-dynamics behaviour of the production under development has been vastly analysed and op- timized based on the multi-discipline optimization (MDO) techniques. Owing to offering numerous built-in interface and integrated optimi- zation algorithm, MDO application software has begun to be used in building optimization design with the complex relationship between various objectives. With the advantage of MDO tools and aimed to provide an efficient optimization approach from the perspective of ar- chitect, this paper proposes a wind-related building performance op- timization design system integrating Rhinoceros and Fluent based on iSIGHT - a MDO application software. In addition, the lighting per- formance is considered in this research as well for implementing the multi-objective optimization. Two case studies of tall building optimi- zation design based on varied generative approaches are introduced to investigate the effect and efficiency of this system.},

  abstract = {Condominium neighbourhoods are emerging in intensifying city centres as a response to market and demographic preferences for homeownership. While the multi-ownership structure of individual condominium buildings accommodates a short-term demand, the long-term implications for neighbourhoods is a source of concern. In particular, the presence of unit owners with varied acquisition objectives can lead to an anticommons problem resulting in building disinvestment due to an inability to reach decisions on sustainable maintenance fees and capital reserve funds, and a lack of end of lifecycle planning. The City of Toronto is experiencing unprecedented condominium development and serves as the basis for a case study that assesses the anticipated future neighbourhood challenges associated with a predominantly condominium-based form of ownership. Twenty-two local stakeholders were interviewed to identify problems that are viewed as sources of concern due to decisions made during the early stages of a building's lifecycle and the absence of a neighbourhood planning strategy. An analysis of the results indicates that lock-in, lacunae and neighbourhood effects will likely complicate revitalisation efforts as condominium neighbourhoods become more prevalent. Limited stakeholder recognition further suggests that it is necessary to raise a greater awareness of the potential anticommons impediments to long-term collective revitalisation actions.},

The air quality standard is an effective prerequisite to ensure the quality of the air. The citation relationships between air quality standards at a certain time point, which reflect technological development and knowledge transition, form a complex network. In this study, an integrated multi-criteria decision making method is proposed to measure the criticality of standards based on a dynamic citation network model. In particular, the Entropy Weight (EW) method is used to set the weights of each node measurement to avoid subjectiveness, while the TOPSIS method is employed to measure the criticality for each air quality standard. A case study based on the data of 444 of China's national air quality standards reveals that the complex network method facilitates the identification of critical standards effectively. In addition, we found that there exist some structural problems in China's air quality standard system: the connectivity between standards is insufficient; critical standards are lacking; and the critical standards change over time following the issue of national policies. Finally, policy suggestions are recommended on strengthening inter-standard citation, attaching importance to the revision of critical standards, and the dynamics of critical standards.},

Yet there are few studies that examine the influence of land-use regulation on housing affordability. Even more uncommon is a focus on the effects of specific types of regulation on individual households, and variations in these effects by racial and ethnic group. Using a cross-sectional regression design analyzing existing Wharton Residential Land Use Regulation Survey data, land use regulation survey data developed by Pendall, Puentes, and Martin (2006), and American Community Survey data, this article estimates the impact of various kinds of exclusionary land use regulation on individual housing affordability by housing tenure and race. We find that mobile home bans have powerful and consistent effects on owner affordability. Affordability for African Americans is especially harmed by multi-family development limits and for Hispanics by restrictions on the pace of housing construction.},

Innovation, diffusion and constructional activity play major roles in the theoretical argument and the implications of their interrelationship for the arrangement of forms within the city are outlined. Regional variations in the adoption of innovations and in constructional activity are considered and their significance for the forms that characterize different towns is discussed.},

Our research shows this concept can be extended to analyse the design of streetscapes in relation to health and wellbeing outcomes. An Australian population health survey (n = 34,000) was used to identify the spatial distribution of health and wellbeing outcomes, including general health and social capital. For each outcome, the most and least desirable locations formed two domains. Streetscape design was sampled using around 80,000 Google Street View images per domain. Generative adversarial networks translated these images from one domain to the other, preserving the main structure of the input image, but transforming the `style' from locations where self-reported health was bad to locations where it was good. These translations indicate that areas in Melbourne with good general health are characterised by sufficient green space and compactness of the urban environment, whilst streetscape imagery related to high social capital contained more and wider footpaths, fewer fences and more grass. Beyond identifying relationships, the method is a first step towards computer-generated design interventions that have the potential to improve population health and wellbeing.},

  abstract = {The built environment has been shown to influence active transportation. Although spatial data for the built environment is increasingly available, there has been little effort to use existing data and knowledge to define and map `bikeability' as an approach to promoting travel by bicycle. Our goal was to build a tool to identify areas that are more conducive and less conducive to cycling. We used empirical research to develop a bikeability index and geographic information systems to map the index across the Metro Vancouver region. Results of an opinion survey, travel behaviour studies, and focus groups were used to identify the components of the index and their relative importance. Pertinent geospatial data layers were scored and combined using a flexible weighting scheme to create a composite map highlighting both high and low bikeability areas. The bikeability index was comprised of five factors shown to consistently influence cycling: bicycle facility availability; bicycle facility quality; street connectivity; topography; and land use. For mapping purposes, we created corresponding metrics: density of bicycle facilities; separation from motor vehicle traffic; connectivity of bicycle-friendly roads (local streets, bicycle routes, and off-street paths); slope; and density of destination locations. Using empirical evidence to combine data layers for these metrics we generated a high-resolution (10 m) bikeability surface for the region, depicting bicycle-friendly areas and areas where cycling conditions need to be improved. Built environment interventions for specific locations are informed by evaluating scores for the five individual component layers. Mapping bikeability provides a powerful visual aid to identify zones where changes are needed to support sustainable travel. This evidence-based tool presents data in a userfriendly way for planners and policy makers. The overall bikeability score and its five component scores can guide local action to stimulate changes in cycling rates. It uses widely available data types, thus facilitating easy application in other cities. Furthermore, the flexible parameters and weighting scheme enable users elsewhere to tailor it to evidence about local preferences and conditions.},

  abstract = {Purpose Model the drivers of Australian housing affordability and forecast equilibrium affordability. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach Uses autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach to model housing affordability measured by the Housing Industry Association's Housing Affordability Index (HAI) and the housing price-earnings multiplier (HPE). Six sets of explanatory variables, including housing finance, housing construction activity and costs, economic growth, population, alternative investments and taxation. Findings Primary long-run drivers are housing finance, dwelling approvals and financial assets. Economic and population growth only have a short-run influence, while housing taxation has limited impact in long run. Forecasts indicate long-run HAI equilibrium values of 109 (above the historical minimum of 107) and a HPE of seven (below the recent historical maximum of 8.2). Research limitations/implications Reduced form model encompassing both demand and supply factors involves complicated interpretation given direct and indirect effects on affordability. Analysis at national level ignores regional impacts that may also affect housing affordability. Practical implications The impact of the low rate of new dwelling approvals (public and private sector in the long run and public sector in the short run) points to a persistent structural gap between the demand and supply of housing. Strong economic and population growth often blamed for the worsening of housing affordability, at least in the 2000s, has no impact at the aggregate national level. Originality/value Only known paper to provide quantitative estimates of macro drivers of Australian housing affordability over a long period using alternative measures of relative housing affordability.},

The paper also provides a suggested framework for future research on housing affordability. Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} The paper employs descriptive analysis of measures of affordability using commercial and other information. In addition, the paper undertakes analysis of the affordability drivers and government responses using recent governmental inquiries and other research into housing affordability. Findings \textendash{} Housing affordability in Australia has worsened significantly in the past quarter century, including in both urban and regional areas, and is now among the world's most unaffordable. The main contributor at the national level has been the escalation of housing prices because of continuing strong demand arising from strong economic and population growth, the availability of cheaper and more accessible finance, and tax and other incentives for home and investor housing ownership. An additional contributor is unresponsive housing supply resulting from an extensive governmental role in land release and zoning, infrastructure charges, and building and environmental regulation. Research limitations/implications \textendash{} As an analytical paper, the central aim is to summarise the findings and conclusions of other work and provide a suggested framework for future research. Accordingly, no attempt made to model directly the relationship between housing affordability, its demand and supply drivers and government policy responses. Practical implications \textendash{} There is a need to reassess government policy at all levels as it relates to population, economic, urban, and environmental planning and government regulation and taxation and housing affordability. Need for future empirical work to quantify the causes and consequences of housing affordability. Originality/value \textendash{} This study provides a complete account of housing affordability and policy and the literature on housing affordability in Australia over the past 25 years.},

Many of the pre-existing conditions that increase the risk of death in those with COVID-19 are the same diseases that are affected by long-term exposure to air pollution. We investigated whether long-term average exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death in the United States. Design: A nationwide, cross-sectional study using county-level data. Data sources: COVID-19 death counts were collected for more than 3,000 counties in the United States (representing 98\% of the population) up to April 22, 2020 from Johns Hopkins University, Center for Systems Science and Engineering Coronavirus Resource Center. Main outcome measures: We fit negative binomial mixed models using county-level COVID-19 deaths as the outcome and county-level long-term average of PM2.5 as the exposure. In the main analysis, we adjusted by 20 potential confounding factors including population size, age distribution, population density, time since the beginning of the outbreak, time since state's issuance of stay-at-home order, hospital beds, number of individuals tested, weather, and socioeconomic and behavioral variables such as obesity and smoking. We included a random intercept by state to account for potential correlation in counties within the same state. We conducted more than 68 additional sensitivity analyses. Results: We found that an increase of only 1 \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend g/m3 in PM2.5 is associated with an 8\% increase in the COVID-19 death rate (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 2\%, 15\%). The results were statistically significant and robust to secondary and sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: A small increase in long-term exposure to PM2.5 leads to a large increase in the COVID-19 death rate. Despite the inherent limitations of the ecological study design, our results},

The main research question is \&quot;How to improve the livability, through enhancing the public space network and adapting the local neighborhood economy in the deprived center-city mixed-use neighborhood?\&quot;.

  abstract = {It is argued that although complexity theory might be useful for simulating various urban processes, it is probably incapable of throwing much light on such a mysterious concept as urban livability. Realistically therefore, city planners trying to boost urban livability can only adopt approximate and heuristic strategies which they think might increase livability and which will probably do no harm. Examples of four such strategies are discussed here. Firstly, improving urban connectivity seems important, and it is argued that Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) achieves this the most effectively. Secondly, clear communication, between the planners and the planned for, seems essential as well, and various innovative methods for achieving this, both now and in the future, are discussed. Thirdly, methods for optimizing urban layouts are likely to help, even if they do not act as prescriptive blueprints but serve rather as discussion generators for assessing the most desirable directions in which the city should be shaped, and two examples of suitable optimization methods are outlined. Finally, it is argued that no city planner can increase urban livability unless they have a viable way of predicting what the city's residents are likely to prefer, and so a generic, preference-prediction method is presented here. The conclusion is reached that in Malaysia, it is the locals who will best understand what urban livability actually constitutes, and so foreigners should demonstrate only technical implementation procedures rather than how to go about achieving such a goal.},

The research is developed through a two-pronged multi-layered planning framework. Firstly, from the maintenance perspective, five intervention approaches are grouped, with a specific focus on the leading structural elements of the urban fabric\&mdash;the arcade streets. Secondly, from the morphological view and through the ecological lens, six characterized areas are identified and classified with respective morphological features and crucial planning problems being faced. This framework provides a strategic thematization of corresponding optimizing strategies and suitable guidelines to direct future governmental actions and to support the self-maintenance of local inhabitants toward sustainable development. The study also presents the possibility that such techniques are applicable to the Chinese context and is expected to inspire further research and practices in China and beyond.},

Firstly, bus accessibility and metro accessibility are calculated according to the space syntax theory. Then, four models, the traditional hedonic price model (HPM) with transport accessibility, the traditional hedonic price model without transport accessibility, the random forest (RF) model with transport accessibility, and the random forest model without transport accessibility, are introduced. Finally, the four models are compared and analyzed in terms of precision and importance of index contributions. Taking Xi \&rsquo;an, China, as an example, the experimental results show that the transport accessibility calculated based on space syntax can accurately represent the transport convenience in an urban space structure. Furthermore, it has a great influence on the contribution of indexes in the model.

For the Vienna-Bratislava metropolitan region, our integrated modeling approach uses a combination of multifractal spatial modeling along with a space syntax perspective. Multifractal strategies are intrinsically multiscalar and adhere to five planning principles: hierarchical (polycentric) urban development to manage urban sprawl; sustainable transit-oriented development; locally well-balanced urban pattern and functions distribution to enhance vital urban systems, local centers, and neighborhoods; penetration of green areas into built-up areas; and the preservation of large interconnected networks of green areas to conserve biodiversity. Adding space syntax modeling to a multifractal strategy integrates how space relates to functional patterns based on centrality, thus applying a socio-spatial perspective. In this paper, we used the following workflow for an integrated modeling approach: (1) Space syntax to identify the urban systems' hierarchy and so determine a spatial strategy regionally; (2) Fractalopolis to create a multifractal development plan for potential urbanization; and (3) Space syntax to design a strategic urban master plan for locating new housing and facilities vis-\`a-vis socioeconomic factors.},

Despite its tremendous impact, the origin of SARS-CoV-2 has remained mysterious and controversial. The natural origin theory, although widely accepted, lacks substantial support. The alternative theory that the virus may have come from a research laboratory is, however, strictly censored on peer-reviewed scientific journals. Nonetheless, SARS-CoV-2 shows biological characteristics that are inconsistent with a naturally occurring, zoonotic virus. In this report, we describe the genomic, structural, medical, and literature evidence, which, when considered together, strongly contradicts the natural origin theory. The evidence shows that SARS-CoV2 should be a laboratory product created by using bat coronaviruses ZC45 and/or ZXC21 as a template and/or backbone. Building upon the evidence, we further postulate a synthetic route for SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating that the laboratory-creation of this coronavirus is convenient and can be accomplished in approximately six months. Our work emphasizes the need for an independent investigation into the relevant research laboratories. It also argues for a critical look into certain recently published data, which, albeit problematic, was used to support and claim a natural origin of SARS-CoV-2. From a public health perspective, these actions are necessary as knowledge of the origin of SARS-CoV-2 and of how the virus entered the human population are of pivotal importance in the fundamental control of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as in preventing similar, future pandemics.},

Nevertheless, the potential economic effect of daily accessed street greenery, i.e., a human-scale and perceptual-oriented quality focusing on exposure to street greenery in people's daily lives, has not been fully studied because a quantitative measuring of this human-scale indicator is hard to achieve. This study was an attempt in this direction with the help of new urban data and new analytical tools. Shanghai, which has a mature real estate market, was selected for study, and the housing prices of 1395 private neighborhoods in its city center were collected. We selected more than forty variables that were classified under five categories\textemdash location features, distances to the closest facilities, density of facilities within a certain radius, housing and neighborhood features, and daily accessed street greenery\textemdash in a hedonic pricing model. The distance and density of facilities were computed through a massive number of points-of-interest and a geographical information system. The visible street greenery was collected from Baidu street view images and then measured via a machine-learning algorithm, while accessibility was measured through space syntax. In addition to the well-recognized effects previously discovered, the results show that visible street greenery and street accessibility at global scale hold significant positive coefficients for housing prices. Visible street greenery even obtains the second-highest regression coefficient in the model. Moreover, the combined assessment, the co-presence of local-scale accessibility and eye-level greenery, is significant for housing price as well. This study provides a scientific and quantitative support for the significance of human-scale street greenery, making it an important issue in urban greening policy for urban planners and decision makers.},

  abstract = {Most cellular automata (CA) urban models assume densities to be uniform for all cells. This is not true in real cities because densities vary substantially from city to city and from urban center to periphery areas. Development density, which affects urban form, is an important factor in urban planning. The authors present a CA model that incorporates density gradient in the simulation of urban development for different urban forms. Development density is obtained from density-decay functions and assigned to the cells when they are converted into developed cells according to CA transition rules. The model, which is based on the concept of ?grey cells?, can be used as a planning model to explore various combinations of urban forms and development densities. The authors also evaluate and compare the development patterns generated by different density gradients. It is found that development scenarios with high-density development can significantly reduce encroachment on agricultural land and other important environmentally sensitive areas.},

Most academic papers on the topic have, so far, been concentrated in Europe and America, with less attention paid to rapidly growing cities in low income nations. This is problematic because transportation networks are rapidly evolving in developing countries and the impacts of misguided transportation policies (including air pollution and road traffic casualties) are particularly acute. Metrics on the performance of street networks could help inform policy. This paper uses the Python package OSMnx to analyze and evaluate street networks in 12 districts of Phnom Penh from OpenStreetMap. Results suggest that topological and geometric characteristics of street networks are more conducive to walking and biking in the central districts than in the peripheral districts. The central districts are also better connected to core network corridors. To promote sustainable urban mobility, new developments and street renewals should be incorporated facilities, services, and safety of walking and biking. Some policy implications are suggested for future designs of the Phnom Penh's street networks to increase livability and sustainability.},

  year = {2017},
  month = oct,
  abstract = {This is the first study on the causal effects of zoning on active living outcomes, and the first study to quantitatively verify the mediation of the built environment for the effect of zoning on active living outcomes. I introduce the causal inference to the literature of the associations among zoning, built environment, and active living outcomes. To solve the endogeneity problem of zoning and built environment, I build two instrumental variables (IVs), which are manufacturing establishment density in 1900 and farmland proportion in 1900. The two IVs represent the conflict between the rapidly-developing manufacturing industry and the traditional agricultural economy in the late 19th century. I show that the conflict gave birth to the American zoning and shaped the built environment by exploring the history and the institution of American zoning. I argue for the validity of the two IVs by investigating the literature and the history of American manufacturing industry and performing statistical analysis. By utilizing IV Probit model and the general method of moments (GMM), I test the endogeneity of zoning and estimate the causal effect of zoning on active living outcomes. In addition, I conduct mediational analysis to verify the mediation of the built environment for the effect of zoning on active living outcomes. The results show that the active living-oriented zoning promotes adult leisure-time physical activity, such as walking, running, and bicycling, and discourages adult leisure-time sedentary behaviors at home, such as TV watching, radio listening, and music listening, partly through shaping the built environment. The data come from five sources. Zoning data originate from the research team at the Institute for Health Research and Policy at the University of Illinois at Chicago and are used to construct the independent variable\textemdash active living-oriented zoning. NAVTEQ 2011 third quarter GIS data and the American Community Survey (ACS) 2011 1-year estimates were combined to build the county-level independent variable\textemdash walkability\textemdash which is used to measure built environment. The American Time Use Survey 2010-2015 is used to create the outcome variables of time usage and individual-level control variables. The ACS 2011\textendash 2015 5-year estimates are used to construct the county-level control variables. The 1900 census is used to create the two instrumental variables.},

The recent advances in sensor technologies and digitization have produced a wealth of data to help research activities by facilitating improved measurements and conducting large scale analysis. This paper explores the potential of big data and big data analytics in the light of current approaches to measuring streetscape features. By applying machine learning algorithms on Google Street View imagery, we generated objectively three measures on visual enclosure. The results showed that sky areas were identified fairly well for the calculation of proportion of sky. The three visual enclosure measures were found to be correlated with pedestrian volume and Walk Score. This method allows large scale and consistent objective measures of visual enclosure that can be done reproducibly and universally applicable with readily available Google Street View imagery in many countries around the world to help test their association with walking behaviors.},

  abstract = {Based on the theoretical foundation of hedonic methods, positive relationships between various types of environmental amenities and house sales price have been investigated. However, as hedonic theory does not provide any arguments in favor of specific sets of independent variables, this lack of theoretical support led researchers to select independent variables from empirical results and intuitive information of previous studies. In previous hedonic studies, the most widely used selection criterion was stepwise selection for multiple regression with ordinary least square (OLS) regression for model fitting. The objective of this study is to apply machine learning approaches to the hedonic variable selection and house sales price modeling. Two rule-based machine learning regression methods including Cubist and Random Forest (RF) were compared with the traditional OLS regression for hedonic modeling. Each regression method was applied to analyze 4469 house transaction data from Onondaga County, NY (USA) with two different neighborhood configurations (i.e., 100m and 1km radius buffers). Results showed that the RF resulted in the highest accuracy in terms of hedonic price modeling followed by Cubist and the traditional OLS method. Each regression method selected different sets of environmental variables for different neighborhood. Since the variables selected by RF method led to make an in-depth hypothesis reflecting the preferences of house buyers, RF may prove to be useful for important variable selection for the hedonic price equation as well as enhancing model performance.},

We divide urban facilities into two categories based on scarcity: irreplaceable and replaceable facilities. We find that the influence of urban facilities differs among different categories and submarkets, and the influence of irreplaceable facilities is highly dependent on accessibility in all submarkets, while that of replaceable facilities relies on both the accessibility and scarcity of those facilities. This study contributes to our understanding of the importance of and differences among the effects of various public facilities on property values in the intra-urban environment.},

The effect of new cycling infrastructure on transport-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is then explored. More specifically, we aim at investigating how commuting cycling modal share has evolved across neighborhood built-environment typologies and over time in Montreal, Canada. For this purpose, automobile and bicycle trip information from origin\textendash destination surveys for the years 1998, 2003 and 2008 are used. Neighborhood typologies are generated from different built environment indicators (population and employment density, land use diversity, etc.). Furthermore, to represent the commuter mode choice (bicycle vs automobile), a standard binary logit and simultaneous equation modeling approach are adopted to represent the mode choice and the household location. Among other things, we observe an important increase in the likelihood to cycle across built environment types and over time in the study region. In particular, urban and urban-suburb neighborhoods have experienced an important growth over the 10years, going from a modal split of 2.8\textendash 5.3\% and 1.4\textendash 3.0\%, respectively. After controlling for other factors, the model regression analysis also confirms the important increase across years as well as the significant differences of bicycle ridership across neighborhoods. A statistically significant association is also found between the index of bicycle infrastructure accessibility and bike mode choice \textendash{} an increase of 10\% in the accessibility index results in a 3.7\% increase in the ridership. Based on the estimated models and in combination with a GHG inventory at the trip level, the potential impact of planned cycling infrastructure is explored using a basic scenario. A reduction of close to 2\% in GHG emissions is observed for an increase of 7\% in the length of the bicycle network. Results show the important benefits of bicycle infrastructure to reduce commuting automobile usage and GHG emissions.},

Such complexity poses a challenge to identify the causes of urban environmental problems and how to address them without causing greater deterioration. Planning has traditionally focused on regulating the location and intensity of urban activities to avoid environmental degradation, often based on assumptions that are rarely revisited and producing ambiguous effects. The key intellectual challenge for urban policy-makers is a fuller understanding of the complexity of urban systems and their environment. We address this challenge by developing an assessment framework with two main components: (1) a simple agent-based model of a hypothetical urbanizing area that integrates data on spatial economic and policy decisions, energy and fuel use, air pollution emissions and assimilation, to test how residential and policy decisions affect urban form, consumption and pollution; (2) an information index to define the degree of order and sustainability of the hypothetical urban system in the different scenarios, to determine whether specific policy and individual decisions contribute to the sustainability of the entire urban system or to its collapse.},

In many cities, particularly those planned and developed with intentional separation of land uses, this return of economic activities to residential neighbourhoods brings along both lifestyle opportunities and spatial challenges. Attempts to formulate appropriate urban planning responses are hindered by the limited understanding of home-based workers' needs and aspirations, as well as their impacts on the built environment. Responding to this knowledge gap, this paper presents the results of a survey focused on urban planning implications of home-based work within the City of Gold Coast (Queensland, Australia). The findings provide strong evidence of home-based workers' preferences for neighbourhoods that integrate residential amenities with place-making initiatives to enhance economic performance, networking and collaboration. Several urban planning recommendations are provided in three separate scenarios to facilitate the formulation of strategies prompting a gradual evolution of residential neighbourhoods towards live/work urban environments.},

In this model, travel demands emerge from the interactions of three types of agents in the transportation system: node, arc and traveler. Simple local rules of agent behaviors are shown to be capable of efficiently solving complicated transportation problems such as trip distribution and traffic assignment. A unique feature of the agent-based model is that it explicitly models the goal, knowledge, searching behavior, and learning ability of related agents. The proposed model distributes trips from origins to destinations in a disaggregate manner and does not require path enumeration or any standard shortest-path algorithm to assign traffic to the links. A sample 10-by-10 grid network is used to facilitate the presentation. The model is also applied to the Chicago sketch transportation network with nearly 1000 trip generators and sinks, followed by a discussion of possible calibration procedures. The agent-based modeling techniques provide a flexible travel forecasting framework that facilitates the prediction of important macroscopic travel patterns from microscopic agent behaviors, and hence encourages the studies on individual travel behaviors. Future research directions are identified, as are the relationship between the agent-based and activity-based approaches for travel forecasting.},

High-resolution remote sensing imagery and multi-source social sensing data were used to provide both physical and socioeconomic information. Four categories of attributes were derived from both data sources for urban land use parcels segmented by the OpenStreetMap road network, including spectral/texture attributes, landscape metrics, Baidu Point-Of-Interest (POI) attributes, and Weibo attributes. The random forests technique was adopted to conduct the classification. The importance of each attribute, attribute category, and data source was evaluated for the classification as a whole and the classification of individual land use types. The results showed that a testing accuracy of 77.83\% can be achieved. The approach is relatively good at classifying open space and residential parcels, and poor at classifying institutional parcels. While using solely remote sensing data or social sensing data can achieve equally high overall accuracy, their importance varies in terms of the classification of individual classes. Landscape metrics are the most important for open space parcels. Spectral/texture attributes are more important in identifying institutional and residential parcels. The classification of business parcels relies more on landscape metrics and social sensing data, and less on spectral/texture attributes. The classification accuracy can be potentially improved upon the acquisition of purer parcels and the addition of new attributes. It is expected that the proposed approach will be useful for the routine update of urban land use information and large-scale urban land use mapping.},

This problem is of great importance to urban development and transportation management, yet is very challenging because the plan would change the local travel demands drastically and the new travel demand pattern might be unprecedented in the historical data. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Conditional Urban Traffic Generative Adversarial Network (Curb-GAN), which provides traffic estimations in consecutive time slots based on different (unprecedented) travel demands, thus enables urban planners to accurately evaluate urban plans before deploying them. The proposed Curb-GAN adopts and advances the conditional GAN structure through a few novel ideas: (1) dealing with various travel demands as the ``conditions'' and generating corresponding traffic estimations, (2) integrating dynamic convolutional layers to capture the local spatial auto-correlations along the underlying road networks, (3) employing self-attention mechanism to capture the temporal dependencies of the traffic across different time slots. Extensive experiments on two real-world spatio-temporal datasets demonstrate that our Curb-GAN outperforms major baseline methods in estimation accuracy under various conditions and can produce more meaningful estimations.},

Conversely, the urban form influences urban activities, resources consumption and the environment. To improve understanding of the impacts of urban form and related urban issues, accurate description of urban land structure is a key information requirement, which include geospatial distributions of land use, surface characters and features derived from remote sensing imagery, as well as from integration and inference of supporting information from diverse sources. This paper presents the results of research on Canadian urban form including land use, land surface characterizations and changes, as well as the relationship of urban form with urban activities, urban commuting as an example, for improvement of understanding of the urban form and its impacts by using spatial information from image data at pixel level. The scope of this research is in a broad range in nature and includes information extraction from remote sensing image data, integration of land use time-series maps from diverse historic sources and finally spatial analysis and modeling of urban land structure impacts on intra-urban commute transportation. This paper presents an example of this data-information-knowledge processing.},

  abstract = {Neural networks are typically designed to deal with data in tensor forms. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture accepting graphs of arbitrary structure. Given a dataset containing graphs in the form of (G, y) where G is a graph and y is its class, we aim to develop neural networks that read the graphs directly and learn a classification function. There are two main challenges: 1) how to extract useful features characterizing the rich information encoded in a graph for classification purpose, and 2) how to sequentially read a graph in a meaningful and consistent order. To address the first challenge, we design a localized graph convolution model and show its connection with two graph kernels. To address the second challenge, we design a novel SortPooling layer which sorts graph vertices in a consistent order so that traditional neural networks can be trained on the graphs. Experiments on benchmark graph classification datasets demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves highly competitive performance with state-of-the-art graph kernels and other graph neural network methods. Moreover, the architecture allows end-to-end gradient-based training with original graphs, without the need to first transform graphs into vectors.},

  abstract = {Fractal geometry has been an important tool in multiple disciplines, but it is usually limited to the geometrical fractal: a shape made of parts similar to the whole in certain ways. Recently there has been increasing interest in structural fractality of complex networks (e.g., biological and Internet hyperlinks) for studying organizational principles and evolutionary rules. In this study, the structural fractality of road networks (a kind of complex geographical network) is examined for better understanding of the complexity and dynamics of the road system. Fifty road networks of the most populous counties in the United States have been used as cases. The Maximum Excluded Mass Burning (MEMB) algorithm rooted in physics has been employed to compute the fractal dimensions by covering the network structure with a series of box sizes ({$\mathscr{l}$} s ). It is found that road networks have structural fractality. The values of structural fractal dimension range from 2.94 to 4.90 spanning {$\mathscr{l}$} s = 5 to {$\mathscr{l}$} s = 15. To examine the self-similar property of the structure of a road network at several scales, small-world and scale-free analyses have been carried out. It was found that road networks are structural self-similarities. The fractal and self-similar structures in a road network help improve the efficiency of flow transmission in the system and keep a balance between chaos and order. These findings help us understand the complexity, organizational rules, and dynamic principles of an urban system and blur the borders across several disciplines. They also provide an empirical guide for urban design and transportation planning.},

This paper therefore critically assesses parametric techniques for facilitating form-based planning in an urban environment. The analysis is to twofold: Can a parametric technique truly enhance the form-based planning process more effectively than existing planning processes? and By what means can form-based planning layouts derived from parametric techniques be appraised? Methodologies include a case study in Hong Kong, quantitative and qualitative analysis, and experimental modeling on parametric platforms. Results indicate that the urban forms can be visualized in real-time during planning processes with a parametric coding system. Existing planning processes do not benefit from real-time visualization, but these alone do not necessarily result in more rational planning layouts. Parametric techniques produce visual models effectively but are not a planning panacea. Findings include a criticism of parametric techniques and pertinent instruments in urban projects, as well as valuable insights for the study of complex form-based planning in dense urban socio-environments.},

The results indicated that vertex strength and cumulative strength distribution, vertex strength and strength rank presented power law distributions, and the AQI network is a scale-free network. Only 17 vertices possessed a higher weighted clustering coefficient; meanwhile weighted clustering coefficient and vertex strength didn't show a strong correlation. The AQI network did not have an obvious central tendency towards intermediaries in general, but 20.55\% of vertices accounted for nearly 1/2 of the intermediaries, and the varieties still existed. The mean distance of 68.4932\% of vertices was 6.120\textendash 9.973, the AQI network did not have obvious small-world phenomena, the conversion of AQI patterns presented the characteristics of periodicity and regularity, and 20.2055\% of vertices had high proximity prestige.

The number of triads 2-012 was the largest, and the AQI network followed the transitivity model.

This amount declined by more than 50\% over our 45-year study period to 36\% in 2005. We compare this pattern with a hypothesized pattern generated by a parameterized intertemporal urban growth model and find that the observed pattern is consistent with urban economic theory, including the implied effects of zoning. Specifically, by fixing the allowable development density, low-density zoning eliminates the incentive to withhold more accessible land and thus reduces leapfrog development, a prediction we confirm empirically. The results illustrate the efficacy of the urban growth model and the substantial influence of spatially heterogeneous zoning on urban land development patterns.},

Current research is limited in using environmental data from different sources in isolation to estimate poverty despite the fact that poverty is a complex phenomenon which cannot be quantified either theoretically or practically by one single data type. This study proposes a random forest regression (RFR) model to estimate poverty at 10 km \&times; 10 km spatial resolution by combining features extracted from multiple data sources, including the National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) nighttime light (NTL) data, Google satellite imagery, land cover map, road map and division headquarter location data. The household wealth index (WI) drawn from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) program was used to reflect poverty level. We trained the RFR model using data in Bangladesh and applied the model to both Bangladesh and Nepal to evaluate the model\&rsquo;s accuracy. The results show that the R2 between the actual and estimated WI in Bangladesh is 0.70, indicating a good predictive power of our model in WI estimation. The R2 between actual and estimated WI of 0.61 in Nepal also indicates a good generalization ability of the model. Furthermore, a negative correlation is observed between the district average WI and the poverty head count ratio (HCR) in Bangladesh with the Pearson Correlation Coefficient of -0.6. Using Gini importance, we identify that proximity to urban areas is the most important variable to explain poverty which contribute to 37.9\% of the explanatory power. Compared to the study that used NTL and Google satellite imagery in isolation to estimate poverty, our method increases the accuracy of estimation. Given that the data we use are globally and publicly available, the methodology reported in this study would also be applicable in other countries or regions to estimate the extent of poverty.},

However, existing studies rarely examine behavioral outputs (e.g., marginal effects and elasticities) that can be derived from machine-learning models and compare the results with those obtained from logit models. In other words, there has not been a comprehensive comparison between logit models and machine learning that covers both prediction and behavioral analysis, two equally important subjects in travel-behavior study. This paper addresses this gap by examining the key differences in model development, evaluation, and behavioral interpretation between logit and machine-learning models for mode-choice modeling. We empirically evaluate the two approaches using stated-preference survey data. Consistent with the literature, this paper finds that the best-performing machine-learning model, random forest, has significantly higher predictive accuracy than multinomial logit and mixed logit models. The random forest model and the two logit models largely agree on several aspects of the behavioral outputs, including variable importance and the direction of association between independent variables and mode choice. However, we find that the random forest model produces behaviorally unreasonable arc elasticities and marginal effects when these behavioral outputs are computed from a standard approach. After the introduction of some modifications that overcome the limitations of tree-based models, the results are improved to some extent. There appears to be a tradeoff between predictive accuracy and behavioral soundness when choosing between machine learning and logit models in mode-choice modeling.},

Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a model frame in machine learning, specially designed to learn and generate image data. Therefore, this research aims to apply GAN in creating architectural plan drawings, helping designers automatically generate the predicted details of apartment floor plans with given boundaries.

In architectural layout design, although architects usually rely on their subjective design concepts to arrange buildings in a site, the judging criteria hidden in their design concepts are understandable. They can be summarized and parameterized as a combination of penalty and reward functions. By defining the functions to evaluate a design plan, then using the simulated annealing algorithm to search the optimal solution, the plan can be optimized and generated automatically. Six penalty and reward functions are proposed with different parameter weights in this article, which become a guideline for architectural layout design, especially for residential area planning. Then the results of several tests are shown, in which the parameter weights are adjusted, and the importance of each function is integrated. Lastly, a recommended weight and "temperature" setting are proposed, and a system of generating architectural layout is invented, which releases architects from building arranging work in an early stage.}

Therefore, this article proposes a method to quantify the design preference of forms using machine learning and find the form with the highest score based on the result of the preference test from the architect. A dataset of forms was firstly generated, then the architect was asked to keep picking a favorite form from a set of forms several times in order to record the preference.

Then, to understand how this network works, the author analysed the frame of the network, and give a detailed explanation about the three working principles of this network, convolution layer, residual network layer and deconvolution layer. Last, to visualize the network in architectural drawings, the author exported the data from each layer and each training epoch as grayscale images, finding that the features of architectural plan drawings have been learned step by step, and stored in the network as parameters. And the features in the drawings become more concise as the network goes deeper, and clearer as the training epoch increases. It might be inspiring comparing to the learning process of our human beings.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a new optimal location model for siting affordable housing units to maximize the accessibility of low-income workers to appropriate jobs by public transportation. Transit-accessible housing allows disadvantaged populations to reduce their reliance on automobiles, which can lead to savings on transportation-related expenditures. The housing location model developed here maximizes transit accessibility while reducing the clustering of affordable housing units in space. Accessibility is maximized using a high-resolution space-time metric of public transit accessibility, originally developed for service equity analysis. The second objective disperses subsidized housing projects across space using a new minimax dispersion model based on spatial interaction principles. The multiobjective model trades off accessibility maximization and affordable housing dispersion, subject to upper and lower bounds on the land acquisition and construction budget. The model is tested using data for Tempe, AZ including actual data for vacant parcels, travel times by light rail and bus, and the location of low-wage jobs. This model or similar variants could provide insightful spatial decision support to affordable-housing providers or tax-credit administrators, facilitating the design of flexible strategies that address multiple social goals.},

  abstract = {The rental housing market plays a critical role in the United States real estate market. In addition, rent changes are also indicators of urban transformation and social phenomena. However, traditional data sources for market rent prediction are often inaccurate or inadequate at covering large geographies. With the development of housing information exchange platforms such as Craigslist, user-generated rental listings now provide big data that cover wide geographies and are rich in textual information. Given the importance of rent prediction in urban studies, this study aims to develop and evaluate models of rental market dynamics using deep learning approaches on spatial and textual data from Craigslist rental listings. We tested a number of machine learning and deep learning models (e.g., convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network) for the prediction of rental prices based on data collected from Atlanta, GA, USA. With textual information alone, deep learning models achieved an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 288.4 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 196.8. When combining textual information with location and housing attributes, the integrated model achieved an average RMSE of 227.9 and MAE of 145.4. These approaches can be applied to assess the market value of rental properties, and the prediction results can be used as indicators of a variety of urban phenomena and provide practical references for home owners and renters.},

  abstract = {Research on the relationship between built environment and PM2.5 has attracted notable attention during the past decades. However, previous studies were less to test the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of on-road PM2.5 and its related factors at micro scale. To this end, collecting high-resolution PM2.5 data by mobile monitoring along different roads in Guangzhou, China, this paper explored the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of the relationship between built environment and on-road PM2.5 during the morning (7\textendash 9 am) and evening (7\textendash 9 pm) rush hours. Semi-variogram method and geographically weighted regression (GWR) model were utilized to reveal the non-stationarity associations among the large spatial dataset. In terms of temporal heterogeneity, the results showed that the spatial independent radii of on-road PM2.5 were 17 m and 21 m for morning and evening rush hours respectively. The aggregated median value of PM2.5 in the morning rush hours was 34.95 {$\mu$}g/m3, while the evening was up to 55.49 {$\mu$}g/m3. There were more significant factors of street conditions impact on on-road PM2.5 in the morning while more significant factors of land use and centrality that reflecting the cumulative effect of daily human activities with smaller buffer thresholds in the evening. In terms of spatial heterogeneity, GWR models achieved much better performance than the global ones of multivariate regression models with lower AICc, RMSE and higher adjusted R2, explaining 10\textendash 69\% of variance across different roads and rush hours. There was a high degree of spatial heterogeneity that the leading factors were different along various roads on rush hours. The results indicated that the policies and interventions should be more targeted to improve the on-road air environment and reduce personal exposure according to the spatial-temporal geographical context. It can be adopted to provide more realistic and practical guides for urban planning and environmental pollution control.},

This paper develops an agent-based RLC-REP joint model as a key component of an integrated land use-transport model, SelfSim. RLC-REP is capable of simultaneously simulating purchasing, renting and investing behaviour, considering the interactions and competitions between different agent types in the housing market, including renter, landlord, purchaser, seller and investor agents, resulting in new residential locations and real estate prices. In addition, the demographic evolution model in SelfSim that is directly linked to the RLC-REP model is also introduced. Next, both global and local sensitivity analyses (SAs), which employ the Elementary Effect Method (EEM) and Once-At-A-Time (OAT) Method, respectively, are carried out to fully test RLC-REP in a numerical example set up based on a Chinese medium-sized city, Baoding. The EEM-based global SAs identify four influential parameters (among the thirty-four) that could significantly influence the outputs of interests. The OAT-based local SAs further explore how these four important parameters influence the outputs, suggesting that the interactions between parameters could heavily influence the model sensitivity. Finally, the potential applications of the SA results to calibrate the model and to set up ``what-if'' scenarios are discussed.},

  abstract = {It is challenging to map large spatial flow data due to the problem of occlusion and cluttered display, where hundreds of thousands of flows overlap and intersect each other. Existing flow mapping approaches often aggregate flows using predetermined high-level geographic units (e.g. states) or bundling partial flow lines that are close in space, both of which cause a significant loss or distortion of information and may miss major patterns. In this research, we developed a flow clustering method that extracts clusters of similar flows to avoid the cluttering problem, reveal abstracted flow patterns, and meanwhile preserves data resolution as much as possible. Specifically, our method extends the traditional hierarchical clustering method to aggregate and map large flow data. The new method considers both origins and destinations in determining the similarity of two flows, which ensures that a flow cluster represents flows from similar origins to similar destinations and thus minimizes information loss during aggregation. With the spatial index and search algorithm, the new method is scalable to large flow data sets. As a hierarchical method, it generalizes flows to different hierarchical levels and has the potential to support multi-resolution flow mapping. Different distance definitions can be incorporated to adapt to uneven spatial distribution of flows and detect flow clusters of different densities. To assess the quality and fidelity of flow clusters and flow maps, we carry out a case study to analyze a data set of 243,850 taxi trips within an urban area.},

Walking to school may help address these problems. Methods: This cross-sectional study examined disparities in the environmental support for walking around 73 public elementary schools in Austin TX. GIS was used to measure the neighborhood-level walkability and safety. Field audits were conducted to assess the street-level walkability. Analyses of variance and regressions were performed to analyze economic and ethnic disparities. Results: For the top-quartile schools with higher poverty or Hispanic student percentages, the surroundings showed higher neighborhood-level walkability with shorter distances to school and more sidewalks compared with the bottom quartile. These areas, however, also had higher crash and crime rates and lower street-level walkability captured by visual quality, physical amenities, maintenance, and perceived safety. In predictions of environmental conditions using poverty and Hispanic student percentages, poverty was associated with many adverse conditions on the street level and with only two favorable situations, shorter distances to school and lower traffic volumes, on the neighborhood level. The Hispanic student percentage did not correlate with most street-level variables, but predicted both increased dangers from traffic and crime and higher neighborhood-level walkability with more sidewalks, greater density, and mixed land uses. Conclusions: Economic and ethnic disparities exist in the environmental support for walking, suggesting},

Walkability, for this article's purposes, entails the opportunity for continuous movement across some distance and therefore engages both the local and global street networks. Urban liveliness, by contrast, may exist in isolated pockets that provide limited support for physical activity. This case study of a large, urban smart growth development in Atlanta, Georgia, provides an example of a new development with characteristics that suggest a high degree of walkability. However, observational data show pedestrians are clumped on relatively few street segments rather than distributed throughout the site, indicating it is unlikely that the site is hosting much walking between the development and its surrounds. This descriptive case study is intended to contribute to more explicit theory of how environmental design contributes to walking.},
