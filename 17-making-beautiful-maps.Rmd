## Making Beautiful Maps {#making-beautiful-maps}

A map _is not_ the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a _similar structure_ to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness.
—Alfred Korzybski, _Science and Sanity_, 1933


**Making beautiful maps**, _or making effective maps_, is comparable to being able to tell a good story. Just like a good story, a beautiful map comprises certain elements that, put together, frame the narrative in a way that makes it easy for others to understand and interpret. In this way, a map is a communication device. It conveys information through a visual representation of the spatial relationships of the features for a specific area. To better understand maps as particular form of visual communication, it may be helpful to think about what it is that maps actually do.

Maps represent areas larger than we can see, usually from above, and some depict phenomena that cannot be seen (Manson and Matson 2017), such as growing seasons. They also illustrate spatial relationships, such as this map showing the percentage of the population aged 65 and over by census tract in Moncton, New Brunswick. We can deduce that those aged 65 years and over are concentrated in certain areas of the city, using census tracts as a proxy.

**Cartography** is the art and science of designing maps and consists of certain principles and rules that help ensure accuracy and clarity. All maps are simplified representations of a place and reflect the particular choices and motivations of the cartographer. Cartography is as much about deciding what to omit from a map as it choosing what to include. Making beautiful maps involves the art, and science, of selecting and modifying data and portraying concepts with clarity and precision. Decisions around colour, font size, graphical hierarchies, classification themes, and legends are all elements of maps that determine how effective, and accurate, they are in conveying information. In this chapter, you will learn about what elements go into making an effective map, the different categories of maps, and the principles of map design.

## Types of Maps

There are many different types of maps. Just try doing a Google search, and you will come across descriptions of thematic, cadastral, topographic, and physiographic maps, to name but a few. There is no standard agreement on how many different categories of maps exist. Although some differentiate among as many as five  types of maps based on the functions they serve (ICSM 2021), all maps can also be categorized into just two types, **reference** and **thematic**. Reference maps represent the human-made or natural features of the landscape and are sometimes thought of as basemaps. They provide information about a particular location, such as in the example below, depicting the longest rivers in the location of Canada and where they overlap with the United States. Topographic maps based on the [National Topographic System (NTS)](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/earth-sciences/geography/topographic-information/maps/national-topographic-system-maps/9767){target="_blank"} are another example of reference maps.

## Thematic Maps

Thematic maps depict the spatial distribution of particular features, which are symbolized according to the quantitative or qualitative values of their attributes. Thematic maps, as the name implies, emphasize a particular theme, using qualitative or quantitative data. Whereas reference maps show the locations of things, such as the locations of mountains, a thematic map might represent the geology of those mountains. 

Qualitative thematic maps illustrate the spatial extent of categorical data (Anderson 2020), such as the 1956 map bedrock geology map below.

) (c) Comtois and Nicholson, [CC BY-NC-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).](images/17-geology.jpg){.center}

Quantitative thematic maps depict the spatial patterns of numerical data, often expressed as rates or percentages, as in the map below showing the difference in population change between two periods, where the difference is expressed as a percentage.

## Choropleth Maps

There are many different types of thematic types. A commonly used thematic map is a **choropleth** map, which applies different colours or shading to the entire extent of a predefined aereal unit (Weiss et al. 2008). Data used in choropleth maps must be standardized and represented as rates or ratios rather than raw counts or numbers.

One of the reasons choropleth maps are so widely used is because much of the data with which we're concerned, such as demographic data, is tied to aereal units like census tracts or counties.

The map below represents, using percentages instead of absolute numbers, the spatial distribution of the percentage of Cantonese speakers per total population in each census tract in the city of Vancouver, British Columbia. Household population of mother tongue language speakers by census tract is an example of demographic data collected by Statistics Canada and can serve as a proxy for linguistic diversity. This map shows greater concentration of Cantonese speakers in census tracts in the East Vancouver area.

This map is also a good example of the potential problems with choropleth maps, which has to do with something called the [Modifiable areal unit problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modifiable_areal_unit_problem){target="_blank"}, or MAUP. This results when data such as population, which is the measurement of population per unit area, is aggregated into an areal unit, where the shape and scale of the unit affects the resulting rates, or values, of the data. In this map example, the areal unit is a census tract, which vary by size and population density across the city and are delineated according to factors other than number of mother tongue language speakers. Without knowing anything about census tracts, we may assume based on this map that an entire census tract contains a disproportionate percentage of Cantoneses speakers, when in reality it may be just a few households more than the census tract next to it. This map fails to convey that kind of nuance and illustrates one of the weaknesses of choropleth maps, in spite of their wide use and applicability, particularly when displaying census data.

## Dot Density Maps

In contrast to choropleth maps, raw data/counts (e.g. number of mother tongue language speakers) as well as rates/ratios (e.g. number of mother tongue language speakers per square kilometer) can be used in **dot density** maps. These maps use a one-to-one density, where one dot represents one count, or a one-to-many density, where one dot represents a number of counts to map the spatial distribution of a certain phenomenon. In the map below, one dot represents 20 speakers, and rather than mapping one language community, we can view the spatial distribution of two language communities to better understand different settlement patterns between two groups of Chinese speakers. 

Also unlike choropleth maps, dot density maps do not need to be tied to enumeration units, although they can be, such as in this map example, which uses another method of mapping the same data that was used in the choropleth map above. For their part, dots are distributed randomly, and a potential misleading aspect of dot density maps is the false interpretation that the dots are placed in precise locations in space.

## Map Composition
Most effective maps comprise standard elements that help orient the map viewer in space and provide helpful contextual information. There is no one way to compose a map, but a good cartographer will arrange and design map elements to provide the greatest clarity. Many maps not only include the phenomenon or object being mapped, called the **figure**, but also the spatial context of the figure, representing where it is in relation to the space around it, called the **ground**. Maps often have a **frame**, which bounds the figure and any other map elements within a predetermined length and width. Some frames are visible to the map reader, while others are not and simply act as a bounding box for the cartographer while designing the map.

## Figure

## Elements of Maps
Whereas the figure is the most prominent element of a map, most maps also contain additional elements that provide important supplementary information, without which the purpose of the map would be less clear. Thinking back to the dot density example from the previous section, it would be difficult to understand what the map was about without a title and a **legend**, which contained labeling and symbols explaining the units in the map. 

Other elements are important for spatial orientation, such as the **scale** and **north arrow**, which provide distance and directional information, particularly critical for navigational maps such as a park trail map.

Just as in writing, it is also important to provide information about the data sources used in creating the map. Not only does this credit the authors of the data, it also provides transparency and the ability to assess the reliability of the data.

## Symbolization
**Symbolization** is the process by which cartographers choose how to represent the features on a map. Unless the map comprises an aerial or satellite image of the surface of the earth, all maps are representations of reality, whereby information is conveyed through the use of symbols.

There are many ways to visually alter symbols - represented by points, lines, or polygons -  to convey information and show both qualitative and quantitative differences between features in the map. These include varying symbols by size, shape, and colour, to name just a few. Using points to map the location of Canada's cities, for example, the cartographer may use different shapes to illustrate differences between cities and towns. To show variations in populations of those cities, the cartographer might vary the size of the symbols.

## Colour
Cartographers use **colour** in maps to communicate information, to differentiate among features, and to illustrate spatial patterns. Maps are interpreted visually, so cartographic decisions about colour are particularly important.

Colour can also influence the feeling of a map. Some cartographers caution against using red for symbols, for example, because it can convey a sense of alarm. In general, it is a good idea to pay attention to how colours convey intensity.

Choice of colours should also take into account that some people are colourblind, especially when choosing a colour scheme. [Colorbrewer 2.0](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3) is an online tool to help cartographers evaluate how easy it is to differentiate among colours in a colour scheme.

Colour is actually comprised of three elements: hue, chroma, and lightness, or value.

## Classification Schemes
Data **classification** is the process of aggregating large numbers of observations into categories of values or data ranges. Classification is typically used for choropleth or graduated symbol maps. The purpose of classifying data is to simplify it for easier interpretation by the map reader. Rather than differentiating each value by modifying the symbol hue or size, values are grouped together into discrete classes.

There are many classification schemes which determine how breaks in the data are defined, and it can sometimes be difficult to understand which classification method is best to use or whether to use classification for your data at all. Choosing the best classification scheme depends on your data, what you are trying to communicate, and who is your intended map audience.

## Generalization
One of the cartographer's biggest challenges in making a map is deciding what information to exclude. Because maps are a representation of reality that must fit within certain dimensions and communicate clearly to the map audience, the amount of detailed information included must be limited. This process of simplifying detailed information is known as **generalization**.

Cartographers have developed many techniques for eliminating, highlighting, or subduing visual information in maps, some of which have been incorporated into geoprocessing tools commonly used in GIS software. For example, merging two or more polygons together can be performed by running a tool.

## Map Design
**Map design** is the process of incorporating cartographic design principles to produce an interesting and effective map. It involves arranging appropriate map elements, such as a title and legend, in a way that is easy for the map audience to interpret, as well as visually foregrounding more important information so that it stands out against less relevant details. Of course good map design is also about making effective choices for symbol colours and situating the map in such a way that the map audience understands its orientation in space.

Good map design effectively integrates map elements with design principles and symbolization to produce a persuasive map (Deluca and Bonsal 2017).
